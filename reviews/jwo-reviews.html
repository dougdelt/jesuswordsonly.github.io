<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: black;">Hi. I just want to say how much I appreciate your hard work. I loved this <a href="https://us4.admin.mailchimp.com/campaigns/show?id=8752568">newsletter</a>. There was so much great stuff in it. I am right with you on the interpretation of these things. You do great analysis and comparison and your argumentation is so very strong. Well, just want to express appreciation. This is really great stuff. And it takes courage too. Thanks again.

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi,Your book, Jesus Words Only, was a monumental validation for my own studies, and your website has been a constructive benefit in my discussions with family members and Paulists. Could you recommend a JWO congregation in NYC area, preferably on Long Island if posible, that I might visit! Thank you for your time and consideration. (Anthony 9/17/2020)</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">I have to tell you that your book has been a tremendous blessing to me. Before I read your book, JWO, I had come across websites questioning &amp; accusing Paul, but I never felt fully comfortable with the idea of identifying Paul as a false prophet until I read your book. Since then, I've purchased at least a half dozen copies of your book to give to friends &amp; family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Thanks again for your kind reply. May our Heavenly Father bless you abundantly for all the amazing work you do with the incredible books &amp; articles you write! Hope you have a</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">I like your articles because you&rsquo;re so thorough. That gives me confidence</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">that what I read is well researched and thought out with every angle</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">covered.

<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: black;">Hello Doug. I continue to devour everything you have referred me to and am amazed at how gullible and deceived I've been regarding Paul. I'm halfway done with your book Jesus' Words Only and am just awed at what you've discovered. (Geri 8/23/2020).</p>
<hr />
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: black;">Hi Doug</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: black;">This note is to express my deepest feelings of appreciation for the hard work and clear thinking that is evidenced by your website. No one has done a better job of revealing the false reasoning of Saul.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hi Doug</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Some years ago, I read most of what you had posted on your website at that time, but I have not kept up with it due to other demands upon my time. I was amused when someone accused me of being a "follower" of yours" due to my objections to Paul. In fact, I had doubts about Paul ever since I first read the Bible cover-to-cover many decades ago. These doubts were made coherent by reading of William Wrede's book <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2xobeagojuksdv1/Paul.pdf?dl=0">Paul</a> which I found at the Yale Divinity School Library in the early 1970s. I was just the second or third person ever to have checked that book out of the library! Therefore, I was deeply skeptical about Paul decades before I ever read your writings. (August 8, 2020, Louis B., Oxford U. Ph.D.)</span><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 24px;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Hello Doug,</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: black;">I wanted to comment and thank you for the amount of time spent and your devotion to research on the subject of Jesus Words versus Paul's strange doctrine, wild inconsistencies and untruths in Scripture.&nbsp; You have made numerous clear and concise arguments in favor of following God&rsquo;s Commandments and Jesus testimony and teachings. I pray that more people&nbsp;pay attention to what you have written and will learn from the incredible volume of writings you have produced.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: black;">Thank you again,</p>

<hr />
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: black;">Doug, I believe in your mission statement with all my heart. I know your work pleases God and He has blessed you with more than 18 million truth seekers. Your website was the first place where I was not met with judgment for believing what God had showed me regarding Paul. I am forever grateful for you and I will as always remember you and those who God sends your way in my prayers. (Sharon July 21, 2020)</p>

I have recently found a renewed faith after an experience I had, and I have been compelled to learn all I can about Yahweh and Yehovah.</span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;" /><br style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;" /><span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">For a long time I have been highly critical of Saul, and it was so eye-opening to find your website. Thank you so much for helping me on my journey. I have learned so much about reading and studying the bible through your website. It has truly strengthened my faith and understanding.</span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;" /><br style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;" /><span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">I noticed you have these PDF lessons in various sections on the website. Is there any place where you have all of these listed together? The lessons are amazing, and I love going through them on the Sabbath.</span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;" /><br style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;" /><span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">Again, thank you and God be with you.&nbsp; (T July 17, 2020)</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">Dear Doug</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">I have probably been a skeptic of Paul for about fifteen years or more and decided not to read anything attributed him for a good decade.&nbsp; Keeping my mind open to the possibility that that&nbsp;it may be me that was the problem, I once read a 500 page commentary&nbsp;on Galatians and the 'Hebrew Roots' attributed author confessed at the end,&nbsp;that even he could not fit all of Paul's comments to be in sync with the rest of scripture.&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself thought, how hard the author had to work; writing 500 pages to&nbsp;explain the mere 6 or so pages of Galatians.&nbsp;&nbsp;Something was just not right and so the book did very little to undo my skepticism of Paul.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">What I earnestly longed for was&nbsp;even the slightest endorsement of him&nbsp;from Jesus, which would settle my skepticism but it just wasn't there convincingly to my satisfaction.&nbsp; What finally stirred&nbsp;me into searching the internet to see if there were others who think like me, was finding a few New Testament verses which suggested a&nbsp;kind of a negative endorsement of the suspect.&nbsp; The search led&nbsp;me to&nbsp;your book -- 'Jesus' Words Only'.&nbsp; Although I recorded my own problems and observations about&nbsp;Paul into a personal log over the years, your book dwarfed my insights exponentially!&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">I am now fully converted and had aroused&nbsp;at least one other person enough to become a Paul skeptic, leading to&nbsp;their eventual&nbsp;conversion after&nbsp;reading your book.&nbsp; Recently, I crafted a little&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">'hand-out'</span>&nbsp;email of my own and sent it to a circle of believers,&nbsp;with the objective of stirring the pot to wake people out of their slumber on this so&nbsp;very important&nbsp;issue.&nbsp; So far, it's mostly been a battle but I'm hoping that at least the seed has been planted and that&nbsp;they may eventually come around.&nbsp; I've attached my circular in a pdf format,&nbsp;which includes an endorsement of the book in question as well.&nbsp; The presentation is in a bit of an&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">off-the-wall</span>&nbsp;format but it's getting some attention.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">Doug, thank you very much!&nbsp; Your book is an inspired&nbsp;masterpiece!&nbsp;Leo (posted 6/30/2020)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">Dear JWO. I knew there are a lot of contradictions between Jesus and Paul. But I chose Paul as it is the mainstream easy gospel that offered a license for my adulterous lifestyle.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">To cut a long story short, I ended all my adulterous relationships this year&hellip;.The Holy Spirit gradually guided me to the truth about Paul and I ended up reading a lot of your articles.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">I think this Pauline test can only be passed if we truly repent and ask the Holy Spirit for guidance. My mum and my son, who are supposedly not involved in deadly sins like my adultery, can easily accept that Paul is a bad guy. But my wife, who still thinks that no repentance whatsoever is necessary, won't even listen.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">**** As long as I stop the sexual relationship, I think Jesus should accept my repentance.****</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">My experience also shows why so many people cannot let go of Paul. (Wi... 6/30/2020)</p>

To find kindred souls. Although I feel cheeky saying this because the way you provide in depth studies with the gazillion of references, I have no words. Other than that, it is very impressive.

<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: black;">Greetings Doug. I just read the article that you linked [<a href="https://www.jesuswordsonly.github.io/topicindex/211-paul-on-rapture-v-the-bible-jesus.html">Paul's View of the Rapture is at Odds with Jesus and the Bible</a>.] Thank you. I have only come to Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior at the first of this year, at a family event where I made a bold proclamation about my wanting to follow and live by God's will to the very best of my abilities, and when I was met by astonishment, I knew that the situation out there was even worse than I had imagined. Unfortunately, alot of <strong>teachers</strong> on line that I like, I believe are <strong>under delusion</strong> as they seem to be following Paul rather than Jesus.

<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">I've only recently started to go to church and noted the following.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">Our church has a husband-wife team pastor. The husband <strong>preaches Paul most</strong>, but not all of the time. The wife <strong>preaches Jesus most</strong> but not all of the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">Consequently, we try as much as we can, to only listen to the wife's sermons. Which is easy during COVID because sermons are online.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">I couldn't keep track because <strong>I cannot bear to listen to the pauline view of things</strong>. My <strong>children feel the same.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">Why line up for nonsense <strong>when we have such a Great Teacher as Jesus</strong>?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">Yes,&nbsp; I feel comfortable in such a circle of followers of Jesus. I've been waiting for a long time to find like-minded&nbsp;souls. ****</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">Praise the Lord, I found your site.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hello, I have been studying much on this website about Paul.&nbsp; I went over things with my 82-year-old father this past weekend, and after a couple of hours I think he finally started to see the inconsistencies in Paul's vs Jesus' messages. My question is: what is the most effective way to share this with others? Do we just send them a link to your website? What about pastors? I have been attending<strong> evangelical churches for over 40 years and every pastor had messages on Paul's works</strong>. I recall<strong> 2 churches spending over a year on Romans--going verse by verse every week</strong>!&nbsp; Would it behoove me to send emails to pastors? Do you go out of your way to send information to pastors or just wait until people visit your site? I stumbled on your site--but<strong> if someone had showed me this information 40 years ago, I would have accepted it and not wasted so much time (and backsliding/etc</strong>) I would definitely have more "fruit" to show for my life to this point. Anyway, thanks. (Lisa 5/5/2020)</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: black;">Most may&nbsp;make&nbsp;mention of a competing belief.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;go way past that.&nbsp; One can get totally absorbed into the other argument.&nbsp; For&nbsp;me&nbsp;it is a must I read your reasoning.&nbsp; I know I must stay grounded and objective but your writing makes so many things easier if&nbsp;you&nbsp;had to do everything yourself.&nbsp; Who would be better to argue these cases than a lawyer?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: black;">There is nothing comparable to JWO site.&nbsp; People are too lazy to do all the work that needs to be done.&nbsp; I am included though before I stumbled on&nbsp;you&nbsp;I was trying to do so.&nbsp; I had 30 videos arguing both sides of Paul and had made up my mind.&nbsp; Your video was the last one I reviewed and the best.&nbsp; When I saw the name of the site I thought it too good to be true.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Hi. I wanted to take some time to thank you for your ministry and your publishing the truth online! &hellip;. The greats in the kingdom of God have found out about Paul and it&rsquo;s right there in scripture that Paul has been exposed !! My name is [Jake]. The Lord has put it on my heart to try to get this message going . You have done a great job. More than I by far&hellip;.This message is the most important in the world and in the history of mankind&hellip;. I&rsquo;m just a common man&hellip; and I have a dream of mainstreaming this message that you have discovered. God bless you. Your friend Jake. (5/29/2019)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: black;">&nbsp;I have long been disillusioned with the vast majority of modern "Christianity" and never really understood why.&nbsp; Last week I prayed God would take me back to the basics, destroying every false notion of Him and His Word.&nbsp; I also prayed that He would give me more of His Spirit and lead me in a way that is pleasing to Him.&nbsp; Through that prayer and God's gracious mercy He has led to your website and others that are showing me the truth.&nbsp; When I read the New Testament without Paul's heretical teachings it couldn't be any more clear, and there is no confusion on any topic of moral relevance.&nbsp; I want to thank you for being a blessing to those searching for truth, the truth that only comes from God through Christ.&nbsp; I and others owe you our very lives for you have been faithful in helping turn the sinner from his way.&nbsp; Be blessed, my beloved brother.&nbsp; May God deal with you bountifully.

Thank you so very much for your book and articles! I pray God protects you from all enemies and this message would get out even more worldwide!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #212121;">I was raised in the Baptist church, always taught the false doctrine of once saved, always saved. Three years ago, God gave me a dream and showed me I had become a dry, dead branch, like Jesus said we would be if would don't abide in Him, and on the verge of Hellfire, due to a secret sin I had not repented of. I was so shocked and terrified, and repented and later left the Baptist church as the Lord continued to open my eyes to the false teachings I had been taught. After that I visited many different churches, looking for the truth and not finding it anywhere...finally i just stayed home and prayed at home.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #212121;">One day, I was praying, and asking God to forgive me for disliking Paul so much...because people always use his words to back up their false doctrines, and asking God why He would go to&nbsp;so much trouble to save Paul if his words have produced so many false teachings...his words just didn't match the rest of the Bible.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #212121;">I thought it was my problem for not understanding, so I determined to read Paul's writings from start to finish and pray for guidance. Within a few chapters of Romans, it became too much to bear, and I started to give up. Suddenly, the Lord spoke to my spirit, and said, Read Revelation! Read what I said against the churches, because ALL THOSE THINGS ARE STILL GOING ON TODAY and you need to know what they are!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #212121;">So I started reading about false apostles, and the doctrine of Balaam, and didn't understand at all, but prayed for understanding! A few months later, God showed me an article online about Paul being false, and everything immediately became clear.****</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #212121;">&nbsp;I traveled to Israel in July, and then God led me to Kenya, Africa in December this year [where I donate my time in an orphanage in return for room and board]. I believe God has called me to spread the message to Christians about returning to the Laws of Moses, before the coming of the day of the Lord, as prophesied in Malachi. I believe God is going to do a mighty work of His Spirit and purify many people before the great darkness comes, that is,&nbsp;the antichrist, and worldwide deception...and then Jesus will come back. ****</p>

I really enjoy your website and can&rsquo;t say how much I agree that Pharisee Saul is not an apostle and his writings may have some historical significance yet otherwise for doctrine the teachings are a stumbling block and are a test from Father YHWH.&nbsp; James B. 4/10/2018.</span></p>

I have to admit that I've fought Paul's attitude all my life, not knowing it was "just his" attitude. I've even cried and screamed at God because Paul's words made me feel like God hates women, and I couldn't figure out why He bothered creating us. Digging around your site, I see there is much to learn...but even more to unlearn.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial;">I find your writings highly impressive. You are extremely intelligent and have an incredible ability at taking something hard and make it to be understood very well. That is truly an incredible ability. There are many uber rich folks who do not even remotely have that ability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial;">After an illness 8 years ago, I got better and then started to go to Christian churches which blew my mind back then with the singing and people calling out and all. So unlike uptight catholic church. I then started to read the Bible.. a lot.. As I do to this day or simply information that is Biblically related.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">As to an elder of a church and a former close friend, I left the church he is at and then yes, when I&nbsp; mentioned the JESUS Words Only website and I was getting the book,&nbsp; well, that was that. Have not seen the guy in nearly a year and a half. Like you say, he said, "Paul wrote half the New Testament!!" Then I point out the differences of what CHRIST says and Paul and I just get a blank stare or the old "Well who is this guy?" Meaning you and the website so I get into that then. Lol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Pauline Christians are an odd lot. Paul basically says women should be quiet in church and wear head covering and yet there are women pastors and Reverends.&nbsp; Then they turn around and quote Paul on other things.. Say what?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">JESUS says one thing and many times Paul says something else and yet Christians do this acrobat act of saying, well that was before CHRIST gave himself up for our sins. Yet as you say in your great book, well JESUS says this for basically many, many more years to come!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">I will continue to read your book, Doug. I think Christians are just so terrified to question anything.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">My last church I was at I felt a bit controlled. If you questioned anything you got snapped on. It all gets so tiring at times. Good teaching and worship and all but you know, Paul is never questioned and if one has issues with something, well, the hint is to then leave and go to another church.</p>

On another note, my wife [an evangelical Christian] is reading your book [Jesus' Words Only] and really, really enjoying it. I get the cliff note report after she goes through a section. You&rsquo;ve certainly got her marveling at how good your work is on this topic! She feels you make a great case on your points.&nbsp;Me, I can&rsquo;t get through a physical book, but maybe down the road if and when I get an IPAD, I can read it on there and blow up the font!!!!

<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Hi Doug,</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">First of all let me say that I appreciate your in depth study of the scriptures in regards to Jesus and (especially) Paul. Through the years I've often wondered why Paul seemed to have 'hijacked' the NT, and having read your detailed examination I can clearly see that my gut reaction has not been wrong. I agree with the writer of 2 Peter (whoever that may have actually been) in his comments on the difficulty / nonsensical nature of Paul's writings, which I've long thought of us confusing at best and contradictory at worst....I think you are definitely doing God's work. It is much appreciated.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">So thank you. (John L. 10/22/2017 &amp; 10/29/2017)</p>

They truly are a spiritual treasure. &nbsp;I am re-reading them closely for the second time. I can't thank you enough for producing them. They are so well researched and thorough. They clarify so many things about &nbsp;the concepts of God and the mission of Jesus that were formerly unclear to me. Thank you so very much for putting in all the time and effort that must have gone into their production. You surely are a lover of the truth.

<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">Good morning,</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">Thanks for your web site and the truth you are proclaiming.&nbsp; I have read the Bible several times and have not been able to understand how Paul's writings fit with scripture as a whole.&nbsp; Very recently I thought perhaps it was a test and began to test my theory.&nbsp; I have come to the realization that it may very well be a test to see if we truly love God.&nbsp; Yeshua warned us in the Gospels of the wolves and the&nbsp;yeast of the Pharisees.&nbsp; And Revelation 2:2 is pretty much the smoking gun.&nbsp; Not to mention there would have to be 13 apostles, Paul's boasting&nbsp;against the 12,&nbsp; and how he is such a coward when he is pushed to give his statements during his trials.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">Every time I have brought up anything about the Law to my family, I am shut down and they get so angry at me.&nbsp; I was also kicked out of church for believing in keeping Shabbat and questioning Paul's book of Galatians.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">I just don't understand how so many wonderful people in my family and in the "church" have been led into something so sinister.&nbsp; It just breaks my heart for these.

<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">I am starting once again to read your book,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Jesus Words Only</span>.&nbsp; I had started it a few years ago after reading your other great book,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Jesus' Words on Salvation,&nbsp;</span>which I found to be extremely interesting.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">You really make great points in JWO!&nbsp; I am only on page 53 so far, but love it.&nbsp; I must admit, I "envy" your academic expertise in the Classics in Latin and Greek, and your scholarship in the two books of yours that I have.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">One reason I had previously quit reading JWO was because back at that time, I was not quite ready to "throw Paul under the bus." &nbsp;Now, I am.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">Based upon Deuteronomy 4:2, 12:32-13-5; and&nbsp;18:15, 18, which verses I was led to back in 2003, my entire understanding of the Bible has changed.&nbsp; For the next 5 and a half years beginning in 2003, about 95% of my Bible study was the Law of Moses.&nbsp; Then, I continued on into the rest of the Old Testament and into the New Testament, &nbsp;My KJV of the Bible that I had received for Christmas in 1962 became a brand new Book to me!!&nbsp; But even during that 5-and-one-half-year period, I found myself quoting Jesus more than ever before.&nbsp; And many people said, "But Paul said..." &nbsp;I would then ask them when Paul became their personal savior.&nbsp; I also asked them, "Who has more authority, Jesus? or, Paul?" &nbsp; I had some people actually tell me they had EQUAL authority and others said Paul!!&nbsp; And I told them, "No, JESUS is the Final Authority on all interpretation of the Scriptures.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">It all came to a head just last Sunday (Aug. 13) when I went with my brother, an ordained minister, to a little church he was preaching at.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">My brother preached on "Grace" and he urged the congregation to write down his cites.&nbsp; When he finished, he had quoted James twice and Peter twice.&nbsp; ALL the rest were cites from Paul!&nbsp; He did not quote Jesus ONE TIME!&nbsp; And with practically every quotation of his, which was liberally sprinkled with "eternal security" doctrine, I kept thinking of Ezekiel 18, Isaiah 1: 12-20, Matthew 19:16-20 and Luke 10:25-28, and many others.&nbsp; It seemed as if practically EVERYTHING my brother was teaching was contradicting Jesus!!&nbsp; That was the final straw!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">I apologize this email is so long, but I just want you to know &nbsp;how much I appreciate your writing the books and your SCHOLARSHIP about the subjects.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #222222;">Thank you very much for all of the time and effort you have put into these books.&nbsp; I am understanding that EXPENSE because I am currently working on my own book about the Bible.&nbsp; I have finished nine chapters in rough draft, so I know a little of what you went through.</p>

I've probably read over 30 articles already, and even finding your site was a serious answer to prayer. I had first heard the notion 8 months ago of Paul being a false prophet, dealt with the initial gut-punch that comes with hearing that, prayed about it, and continued on my search for truth ultimately coming to the realization that a lot of what he stood for does seem to be in direct opposition to Yahushua/Jesus' words. I believe the Father had given me a peace about this idea. Chris (2/15/2017)</span></p>

I have just referred another once more to your "Jesus' Words Only" website, and I wanted to take the time to tell you I do appreciate your effort to set the record straight. Because of the confusion about Paul, Protestant Christianity is fading away [in Latin America], and Pagan Roman Christianity is growing. I pray the Lord leads millions of believers to your site. May you and your loved ones be blessed abundantly for your work in the Lord's fields. Victor....MsD (2/15/2017)</span></p>

The amount of damage this faith alone doctrine has done to me alone is incredible. The contradictions and anti-Christ teachings are frankly shocking and very upsetting. I am convinced this is the reason why so many Christians are being attacked. When I read Deuteronomy for example it is simple and clear. When I read Jesus words, they are truth. Paul just makes me cry. None of what he says makes any real sense and he walks all over Jesus&lsquo; commandments.</span></span></span></span></span>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hi Mr. D....</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I wanted to take the time to say "thank you!!" for writing your amazing books Jesus' Words Only and Jesus Words on Salvation. These books are so&nbsp;unique in their kind. There aren't ANY other resources like it, as far as I can tell.&nbsp;If you would not have written them, I don't know how I would have put things together in the way that I'm able to now.&nbsp;Just "thank you" really doesn't cover my gratitude over the content of your books and what I am discovering in them. Your words and research have brought me&nbsp;incredible joy as I am rediscovering God's truth in His word.&nbsp;I have been a searching and confused&nbsp;Christian for years now. My search began after leaving the evangelical church and starting to read the Bible for&nbsp;myself for many hours per day.&nbsp; I found so&nbsp;many discrepancies with the teaching of the church as compared to the scriptures that I never saw before&nbsp;while I was part of a&nbsp;church, and being taught the word by pastors. Eternal security, salvation by faith alone,&nbsp;the rapture doctrine, the trinity, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, during my journey I seriously began to question Paul. &nbsp;As a result, I was so confused and up in the air about what to believe anymore. &nbsp;All the while reading the Bible searching for truth. This state of being lasted for a couple of years.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came across your website and your books I decided I had to&nbsp;read them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="background-image: initial; background-color: white; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Well, your books have provided a landing strip for me with its clarity and thoroughness. A landing strip on which to land from my years of circling and searching for a logical path that I was hoping for to find in the scriptures.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am finally able to put the puzzle&nbsp;together to a much greater extent, thanks to your writings. For that I am eternally thankful to you. Thank you for writing these. I'm sure you did not write them with the intent that they would become best-sellers, as we all know how blind and deaf and stubborn those caught up in churchianity can be. So I guess that you wrote them only&nbsp;because of your love for truth. &nbsp;And as an aid for the few among us, whom God has graciously given eyes to see and ears to hear the truth when it crosses their path. Your books have the&nbsp;eternal value&nbsp;a million times over the monetary price for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="background-image: initial; background-color: white; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Your books are written so very thorough, I can see the incredible effort and care with which you have put their content together. &nbsp;I own many, many books on christianity, religion and the Bible but your two books BY FAR are my most valuable resources, and I expect I will read them several times. They provide me with real tools to reach those around me who are lost in Paulianity and evangelical teaching.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="background-image: initial; background-color: white; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">It sure is a lonely road towards the Father, but it all will be worth it in the end.</span></p>
<p style="background-image: initial; background-color: white; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">THANK YOU again, from the bottom of my heart for your obedience to the Father and for your love for the truth and for materializing&nbsp;the insight that the Father has given you. May you be repaid many times over in heaven for your efforts here on earth.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Finding your website is truly a blessing. I have long questioned the philosophies presented by Paul and held my opinion that the book of Mathew is the most reliable gospel.&nbsp; I myself am a Christian, and follow the words of Jesus to the best of my ability, yet I am not perfect. I look forward to reading more of your pages and articles but I have many questions. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">When I saw your site and your offer to answer questions I couldn't help but reach out. Everything seems to affirm that I was asked to seek these things out, yet guidance is a difficult thing to find in this world, and the scriptures are deep and easily misunderstood. Also I know that the word of man could have surely found its way into these pages and I want only to know my Father in heaven more. (J. 6/28/2016)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">I want to thank you for your wonderful website and articles. As I have delved deeper into the Bible, I have become more suspicious of the &ldquo;false grace theology&rdquo; crowd and I noticed that they were always quoting Paul. They would never mention repentance. I always knew something was wrong. Thank you for your wonderful insight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #1f497d;">Hello&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #1f497d; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; background-color: transparent;">When YHVH first opened my eyes to His Word I strove to obey it by following &lsquo;Jesus&rsquo;. (June 4</span><sup style="color: #1f497d; font-family: 'times new roman', times; background-color: transparent;">th</sup><span style="color: #1f497d; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; background-color: transparent;">, 1990)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #1f497d;">I then &lsquo;learned&rsquo; I was supposed to follow the apostle to the Gentiles, Pharisee Paul. (1999) My walk with God suffered. It was confusing and divisive. I was what Vernon McGee called an &lsquo;ultra-dispensationalist.&rsquo; &nbsp;I was taught that God wanted us to take Paul&rsquo;s writings at their word, trumping all &lsquo;Scripture&rsquo; that conflicted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #1f497d;">Then, late in 2015, I heard your <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/donald-james-parker/2015/06/27/wielding-the-sword-of-the-spirit--with-douglas-del-tondo">interview</a> and went to your website. Now I follow YHVH and His chosen King, His own right arm, Yehoshua Ha Mashiach, soon to be revealed as the &lsquo;Word of YHVH&rsquo;. (Rev. 19:13) Woo Hoo!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #1f497d;">I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for being obedient, using your considerable talents to right a grievous wrong regarding our Father&rsquo;s real message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #1f497d;">As you know, Dad&rsquo;s message is so dang simple a child can understand: We are all YHVH&rsquo;s kids. Our Big Brother saved our butts. At least for those who, like Him, truly love and try to obey Dad. To obey is to love and care for fellow &lsquo;earthlings&rsquo;, our brothers and sisters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Bless all of you in your organization for the truth you set forth.&nbsp; I am a retired high school teach (English, art, music, home economics, and Bible) who is ambitious to know the truth and follow only the truth.&nbsp; In my many years of Bible study I have come to question whether Paul&rsquo;s great ethics even have a place in the Messiah&rsquo;s true gospel.&nbsp; Through the past 1800 years, many have questioned whether Paul was an infiltrator to destroy the Truth from within.&nbsp; I have researched Marcion, Gnosticism, Zoroaster, Cerenthus, and numerous contributors to the Pauline message. &nbsp;My purpose has been to find &ldquo;pure&rdquo; truth; but, I have hoped to find some justification for his numerous contradictions to Yahshua (Jesus) and to Moses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Is it because you have found him to be a deceiver that you promote &ldquo;Jesus words only&rdquo;?&nbsp;&nbsp; I have written over 400 pages on Paul&rsquo;s life, influence, and contradictions&mdash;never published&mdash;and it disturbs me greatly that Commandment-keeping churches elevate him to equality with, or corrections of, the messages of Yahshua, Moses, and the prophets!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I came out of the Adventist Church twelve years ago, and have fellowshipped with various off-shoots of World Wide Church of God and some Hebraic Roots groups.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Over the last several years my older brother has been helping me awaken to the reality that we live in. A few months back, he asked me one question that has shaken my faith right down to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">the foundation it was built upon. &ldquo;Do you believe in Paul or Jesus?" But hey, after 45 years of being a Pentecostal and feeling solid in my faith, I started researching. If one cannot question his own beliefs (as LDS members fear to do) and dig for answers, then I don&rsquo;t believe that is a true religion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Eventually my search results landed me on your web site and I began to dig and read and research more. Verifying my findings with other sources which confirmed my findings, I was able&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">to understand how people are getting confused and how church leaders can steer a congregation to the left or to the right.****</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">While discussing the epistles of Paul with my mother (70 years in AG) and going over the contradictions, she agreed with each one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">She had never been presented with this type of presentation and began to understand that I wasn&rsquo;t renouncing my belief in our Lord Jesus Christ. Instead, she realized I was simply removing the confusion. It is not my place to condemn, curse or judge Saul. But by simply placing the epistles of Paul aside and following the word of God allows me to become even closer and stronger in my Christianity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Hi! About a month ago I had a true moment of conviction from the Holy Spirit and decided to turn back to my faith in Jesus (or at least what I thought I had left). When I began to study the Bible again I asked God for wisdom to understand things that have troubled me over the years, and the Lord spoke to me (believe it or not). He told me, "You're going about this the wrong way. You're trying to interpret the teachings of Jesus by the epistles instead of using Jesus' teachings to interpret the other texts." I've often found over the years that I have had great joy in studying the prophets and Jesus' words, but Paul has always troubled and confused me. I'm an academic, so after four years away from biblical study my approach has been to review things critically. Paul's teachings are inconsistent with Jesus' message. ****&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Thanks for this site. I've only read a bit here, but it's blessed me tremendously to know I'm not the only one who has been troubled by the inconsistencies. </span></p>

I am amazed to find someone who has a website that is so much in agreement with the thoughts and conclusions I have reached in my spirit for some time now. &nbsp; In fact I have felt that teachings of Paul were so in conflict with the teachings of"The Master" that I had all but given up on what is referred to as Christianity today. &nbsp;I was looking for something that is based on The Early Church and the true teachings of Jesus. Something like "The Way", as spoken about in the Gospels. Your website is one of two I've found that teach the truth concerning Yeshua/ Jesus...most of the others have been been tainted by the writings of Paul. Thank you again and God's Blessings, Gary.

When I first started reading it years ago, something just didn't match up about his spirit. It was like Paul invited himself to a party he wasn't invited to. Most kids are taught not to question The Bible, but we are to compare everything to Biblical truths. Your insights are compelling. As long as we hold dearly to the words of Christ, everything else is moot. Thanks T (January 16, 2016)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I finished your book Jesus&rsquo; Words Only. &nbsp;Excellent!! I have been enjoying reading many different articles on your site. &nbsp;In one article in particular (I can&rsquo;t presently recall the title) I was very excited to see Anthony Buzzard and Frank Viola mentioned. As to my issue with Paul-this originally started with a sense of confusion, and feeling as though there were two different messages being taught in the New Testament. &nbsp;I eventually realized Paul was the problem, but didn&rsquo;t quite know why. &nbsp;For years now, I&rsquo;ve vacillated between believing he is a false prophet or that he is just misinterpreted. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Hey Douglas. How are you? I'm doing great. I just wanted to share wth you when we were in the South Pacific at a YWAM base visiting I was able to share with a guy who had come to my study room he was involved in sexual immorality. He went through a Discipleship Training School and he was hoping <em><strong>to be set free from his sexual immorality lifestyle</strong></em> but because the YWAM base was<em><strong> also teaching Paul's gospel he was able to justify continuing in his sexually immoral lifestyle</strong></em>. When I met him it was the last two nights before he was to leave to go back to California and I was able to share with him for 3 hours and explain to him the Gospel according to Jesus and his eyes were opened once I explained the difference. He was totally saved. And the next day he shared with his team that he had been saved by Jesus Christ and it was only because he rejected the words of Paul and trusted the words of Jesus to repent, believe and obey that he got saved.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;">So I just wanted to pass on this story to you that I had in dealing with this young man from California that was gloriously saved by the words of Jesus - the gospel of Jesus Christ. So thanks to you for doing the work you've been doing and the work you have done and continue to do. This is also to your credit that this young man was saved so I just wanted to pass this good news on to you and to show you that there are many people like him that continue to live in sin because of <em><strong>the mixed words of Paul with the words of Jesus</strong></em>. And so <em><strong>once he rejected Paul's words and received the words of Jesus he was saved</strong></em>. He understood, and the light came on, and his eyes were opened and he was born again. Six months he had been in a Discipleship Training School and they had no clue of how to reach this person engaged in sexual immoraltiy on their team. Now he was saved. It's only <em><strong>because he accepted the words of Jesus - repent, believe and obey</strong></em>. This is the fruit of your labor, God bless u!

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Dear Brother Douglas.&nbsp;Praise and Glory to Yah!!!&nbsp;We are now aware of the wrong words of the man who calls himself an apostle of Jesus (Paul). He is just a mere person, speaking evil to the chosen people of Yah. He speaks against the Torah and the doing away of Yah's commandments. You helped me greatly to understand this Paul. I have helped our orphans and members to understand the truth. Christians must decide whether&nbsp;Paul is to be called an apostle or not. I have now the full idea about Paul's evil words and poor teachings in all his so-called letters. I came to disqualify all his letters. This man is from the Devil. I classify him as the False prophet without fear.</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">How can a man be against Yah's Chosen generation, Against the Torah and Yah's commandments -- even the Shabbat, and people still call him an apostle!!!????

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I stumbled upon your site in my research and I am very grateful for it. For over a year now I have felt very strange when it comes to Paul. It began in a heated conversation in my small group about how we should cast out homosexuals. I argued that that is not how Jesus calls us to behave. He calls us to love and to not judge. Since then I have researched Paul and it seems I am not the only one who questions him. I have a VERY hard time believing his conversion story, but I feel blasphemous wanting to toss out over half of the New Testament. I was raised Baptist and currently attend a "baptist" church, although it is basically non-denominational. My question is - is there a denomination or religion that believes everything in the bible EXCEPT Paul's writings? I do not believe I am Jewish as I believe Christ to be the Messiah. Where is the in between?</span></p>

We were all in on what Jesus says before this. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve not read Paul&rsquo;s writings in any length to have even remotely thought to take his words over Jesus&rsquo;s. &nbsp;The mere thought sends shivers up my spine. &nbsp;Doesn&rsquo;t mean that things he may have written didn&rsquo;t work into one&rsquo;s mind or thoughts, but who ya going to put your faith in? &nbsp;Our beliefs are in Jesus, that&rsquo;s clearly our &ldquo;center&rdquo; of our foundation. &nbsp;Your writings create an emphasis on that and clarifies other issues that one should be aware of.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">You folks have done an amazing job shedding light on what has been hiding among us in plain sight for over a thousand years, taking advantage of people&rsquo;s naivet&eacute;, ignorance and general inability to investigate in depth due to the nature of the subject and the expertise necessary to make sense of the volumes of documents that overwhelms even the academics. It was difficult for me to overcome the idea that people who present themselves as representatives, or agents of &ldquo;God&rdquo;, could be so driven by conflicts of interests with those they claim to care for! Exceptions notwithstanding, that is the sad truth. </span><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">THANK YOU for taking the time and I truly appreciate it.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I'm enjoying all that there is to read on your website. I have such a hunger for this truth and it is a blessing to have someone that shares the same view as myself. I grew up in the Full Gospel Church. But at the age of 14, my mother joined the Seventh Day Adventists. It was a bit confusing to keep Sabbath on a Saturday but later it did make sense. Later in my adult years and married life I went back to the Full Gospel. But Yahweh in all of His wisdom from thereon directed my life and I now can see Yahweh's hand in all of it. In 2012,&nbsp; I started questioning Paul because I realized if Jesus tells us repeatedly in Revelation the same commandmends as when He was walking on earth in the flesh, how is it possible that in between those pages I'm being told not to keep the commandments. It didn't make sense to me. But I will ever be thankful for the day I came across your website. Thank you again sir. Yahweh' blessings be upon you.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">L (1/11/2015)&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Years ago I considered Paul, his work, and his ideas, and then I asked myself a question: "Why did Jesus need this third leg in His operation? Didn't he already have twelve Apostles for this work? Why would he work with and train twelve men to carry out His mission, only to usurp that purpose and hire this Saul fellow, giving him 2/3rds of the NT and a prominence that eclipsed all the others? What exactly could Saul do that the Apostles couldn't? It doesn't make sense."</span></p>

Paul needlessly gunked up the simplicity of Yahshua, and with it, the lives of countless Way-farers. When I compare his complicated writings with the simplicity, directness, pragmatism, and good sense of the other epistles, it becomes clear that Paul is an eyesore. He talked too much for someone who told the truth. Moreover, I suspect Paul is very much of the lineage of </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Magus" style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large; line-height: 1.3em;">Simon Magus</a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">; </span><em style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large; line-height: 1.3em;">i.e.</em><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">, the spirit of that wicked man. Both desired the office of an Apostle and both had his means of acquiring it. Magus used Magick as his sorcery, and his sign of a man God-approved, and Paul used conceptions and argument and dogma as his personal Magick for the same purpose. And people have been laboring under the spell of his writings since.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hello Doug,</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"> After emailing you, I started reading other parts of your website and stumbled on your beliefs page. I began reading your book, maybe a year ago? Not sure. I just recently came back to it after reading that other book on Paul (Yada Yah's book <a href="http://questioningpaul.com/Questioning_Paul-Apostle_or_False_Prophet-00-The_Truth_About_Paul.Paul">The Truth About Paul</a>.). I've been struggling over Paul for about a year or so. There were so many contradictions and things that just didn't make any sense. Then, the past few days, I've been devouring your book. (It is quite good and the case is ironclad that Paul is definitely, in my mind anyway, "The" False Apostle). I haven't really been able to stop reading it (HTML version).</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"> The reason I was conflicted is because of all the intricate exegesis' on Paul by Hebrew Roots people. (Eliyah.com has videos that teach Paul was just "hard to understand.") I tried to buy into these explanations but the arguments had too many holes in them. Besides that, if you just read Paul and let him speak through his own words, well, you know what happens then. Even my mother realized this and she isn't what I would call someone who is passionate about studying the scriptures. (I say that respectfully of course, my mom is a loving person). She considered Paul to be at the very least, very, very confusing.</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"> It seems like people have to go through an extreme amount of scriptural acrobatics to justify Paul's confusing and contradictory epistles. So much so that they somehow sacrifice their own credibility in the process. What exactly are they holding onto, or rather, why do they hold onto Paul so vigorously? It always amazed me at how people can be so intelligent and bright in seeing one truth while being completely blind to another, almost obvious truth.</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Mario (11/11/2014)</span></p>

After 30 years a Christian, I find I am now all alone in my thinking, except for my mother who has been Christian for 50 years, who also has now seen it, through what I have shown her. I rumbled Paul around a year ago after over 3 decades of believing he was God&rsquo;s special Apostle, but I&rsquo;ve got his number now. That&rsquo;s how long it took me. I don&rsquo;t believe people see it without lots of study, which most Christians don&rsquo;t do. They seem to think the Bible miraculously got put together by the hand of God, and therefore do not question anything. To them, Paul is as important, if not more important, than Jesus himself.

<hr /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I have felt like I live on an island for the 3-1/2 years that I have known about the problem of Paul.... I taught in a Baptist church (7,000 members) 3 times a week to ladies: Tuesday night Bible study; Thursday morning Bible study and Sunday morning Bible study for 12 years....The revelation of "Paul" actually came to me in a Bible study in 2011 as we were about to study JAMES. &nbsp;Beth [] was leading it and began by telling us to turn to 1 Cor. 15. As she began reading the list of people who first saw the resurrected Jesus I sat there staring at the page, and I was fearing my thoughts might actually be heard. I could not wait to get home and begin checking out Paul, thinking I must be crazy to question anything in the Bible. &nbsp;Finally, after two years and 17 notebooks (handwritten) on this topic, it came into my mind "Could ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD POSSIBLY BELIEVE PAUL IS A FALSE APOSTLE?" &nbsp;I felt like I was the only one. So I googled "Paul true or false apostle," and I got your website. &nbsp; I know I am CALLED TO THIS MESSAGE but WHO IS GOING TO WANT TO HEAR IT? &nbsp;The true remnant, I know, but WHERE ARE THEY? &nbsp;I just need ONE to encourage me. &nbsp;We have all been so deceived for so long. It is so obvious to me now once my eyes were anointed &nbsp;with eye salve. God has "opened my eyes to see WONDERFUL THINGS IN HIS LAW." &nbsp;Paul caused all the confusion, and I believe the days are coming soon when the Father will remove this sickness from the midst of us. &nbsp;(J 4/24/2014)</span>

I agree with you about Dispensational theology under the section &ldquo;<a href="http://www.jesuswordsonly.github.io/">Competing Love For Paul / Pauline Doctrine</a>&rdquo;. Although I fall under covenant theology, my brethren and I in the churches of Christ strongly disagree that Christ&rsquo;s words before His resurrection would not apply to the New Covenant as some do believe, and add to that the numerous prophetic predictions throughout the Old Testament especially from Isaiah to Malachi include the everlasting covenant to come by God&rsquo;s Messiah. Lastly, we do disagree that Christ&rsquo;s words are contrary to Paul&rsquo;s.

He had 3 different stories. Acts 9, Acts 22:5-, Acts&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07_A6GlD_so#t=26m13s" rel="nofollow" class="ot-anchor" style="color: #2793e6; cursor: pointer; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">26:13</a>&nbsp;-18. The men see a man but heard no voice, then heard a voice but seen no man, Paul only fell to the ground, and then they all fall to the ground. Which story is it? Translation issues are out of the question. These scriptures are completely opposite of each other. At this point I knew something was fishy about Paul but I didn't quite get it. But I left it alone and kept going to church believing &nbsp;and being faithful and quoting from Paul all the time. Then I came across Jesus' words only and boy am I glad I did. Now I feel I have a revelation that most don't know about and I'd like to know how to go about telling others though about it.

They told me that believing Paul was deceived by a false Jesus, was a trip down a slippery slope, because it would put into question a good portion of the New Testament, and that's why they would continue to support, and preach, Paul's writings and work.</span></p>

No man can serve two masters.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">. You seek the truth and study diligently. I think you would agree that Paul said some things true and edifying, no matter how wrong you think he was overall.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul denied being taught by the Twelve apostles. So, he had the being saying "I am Jesus" to depend on for information. But surely anyone who witnessed or heard of the Twelve saying gentiles should not eat idol meats, blood, and strangled meat would see that Paul is not following the words of Jesus or his apostles on that issue. So, they must put down the Twelve and elevate Paul, saying the Twelve were meant to minister to Jews (circumcized) and Paul to the gentiles (uncircumcized) or Jews who recognized Jesus as the Messiah. Of course Paul says this, but that doesn't establish its truth. Wouldn't it imply that the Twelve were lying or wrong or uninspired? You are left with a tangled web, no matter how you approach Paul, IMO. To me, the truth should be simple - so simple that a child can understand. &nbsp;Ian (10/1/2013).</span></span></span></span></div>

If Paul can be accepted on his own testimony,&nbsp;visions, etc. then why can't Joseph Smith or anyone else for that matter? I thought the <a href="/reviews/jwo-reviews/56-marcionism.html" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">article about Marcion</a> was very interesting and that the church put Paul's writings in the Bible to stop a split... There is no doubt that the modern American is Marcion to the core; all the works on systematic theology are due to people trying to reconcile Paul and Jesus unknowingly.</span></p>

If there are only 12&nbsp;then how is there 13? No basis whatsoever for this claim and&nbsp;since Paul claims he is #13 then he is deceived. If this is the case, then how is he trustworthy at all? &nbsp;I believe that the reason Paul is so revered is that&nbsp;his writings teach&nbsp;pastoral authority, eldership,&nbsp;antinomianism, etc. If you follow Paul, you have all the justification to demand total submission from a congregation and money for hire. So money, power, prestige, and an antinomian doctrine of salvation is very attractive to leaders in modern Christianity. Since seminaries and pastors are mostly Pauline the words of Jesus get little attention. Many leaders don't want people to understand their freedom in Christ.&nbsp;</span></div>

I am looking forward to reading more about&nbsp; Paul vs Jesus....I was raised in a dispensational family and made a&nbsp;profession of faith when I was ten. I constantly doubted my salvation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone told me I was saved because I asked Jesus to save me, etc. So when I was 22 I started attending church regularly and joined a very dispensational group. As I read the Bible, I started having problems with many things in the gospels and one of my cousins gave me John Macarthur's book, <em>The Gospel According to Jesus</em>. I read it several times and realized that there were major problems with dispensationalism but never would I have ever thought that Paul was the issue. I always thought that my understanding was the problem and I could never make sense of 2 Corinthians, Romans 7, etc.</span></div>

I have been taught that the law is binding unless repealed vs dispensationalism and all the misunderstood passages are concerning circumcision etc. This does not take into account why Paul told people it was okay to disobey Acts 15, why he set up titles and positions, why he said it was okay to demand money, guilt trip people about what he had done for them and talk about his being taken up into the third heaven. Why didn't Peter and all those with Jesus get taken up into heaven?&nbsp;If all this did happen then Paul is on a higher plane than the true apostles, Moses,&nbsp;John the Baptist,&nbsp;John who received the Revelation, David, Solomon, Noah, etc. (S 7/1/2013)&nbsp;</span><hr /></div>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I first started doubting Christianity how I knew it in late 2011...</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">For a couple of months I just did not read the Bible and I kept praying to Jesus to show me what he is really like! I purchased the Jewish New Testament by David H. Stern, hoping this would show me how Paul really meant things. Well no, I didn't, find it there, of course. Still I kept praying daily to Jesus, asking him why did Paul make things so hard? I thought I was losing my faith.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;So I enquired online, but I was cautious, not believing everything. Still, what I found threw me over! I thought I was alone with my belief that there was something wrong with Paul!!</span></span></span></p>

[i.e. Jeremiah 14:14 et seq. that false prophets say all is well, and nothing to fear]. &nbsp;I actually find the justice of YHVH and His requirements for obedience to be far more &lsquo;comforting&rsquo; than the gospel of grace message Pauline Christianity preaches today.&nbsp; I fear we are reaping the result of this &lsquo;unconditional love&rsquo; and free forgiveness/nothing you can do to &lsquo;earn&rsquo; your salvation message in our society today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Brief summary of this email: I have learned from you, and value your writings. Based upon our discussions, your writings as well as a great deal of prayer, research, study, and debates with a great many other 'believers', in other words, I considered all evidence and information that I could find, I now fully agree with you about Paul being a false prophet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">For me, my primary objection to Paul's teaching is his pronouncement that God's holy law no longer applies. Regardless of all other objections to Paul, for this reason alone, I reject Paul as a teacher of truth. Paul's teaching that we are to submit to earthly authority and its law while at the same time rejecting God's holy law is clearly a teaching of the adversary. As I am sure you will agree, we are to completely submit ourselves to God, not man. (R of Costa Rica 2/16/2013)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hi:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">&nbsp;Thanks a lot for your writings. I have always had a bad feeling and my reservations about 2 authors from my very childhood and I never knew why: Ellen G. White and Paul. After my real conversion and repentance I decided to follow the truth and only the truth and God showed me that first of all I should reject all the writings of Ellen G. White (I was raised in an Adventist family).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The issue of Paul never came until I finished my serious study of God&rsquo;s word in chronological order (from Genesis to Revelation). Everything is in harmony from the beginning, even with the gospels, but when I reached the letters of Paul my mind started feeling uneasy again, like in my childhood. My messianic point of view helped me to study Paul with a Jewish perspective and background, but <em><strong>there were statements too shocking to be defended or supported by any true believer</strong></em>. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2014&amp;version=NIV">Romans 14</a>&nbsp;[<em>i.e.</em>, abrogation of Sabbath / no food unclean]&nbsp;was way too much for me.</span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;" /><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;" /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">God led me to one site attacking Paul&rsquo;s ministry in such a harsh way that I even question if this was the way of defending God&rsquo;s stand from a true follower of the Messiah, &hellip; but I kept searching. I bought the book &ldquo;<a href="/recommendedreading/293-robbing-peter-to-pay-paul.html">Robbing Peter to Pay Paul</a>&rdquo; thanks to your Recommended Readings section, because I could not buy JWO in a kindle version (very practical). I was amazed by all the existing proofs of Paul&rsquo;s false ministry in the Bible and history that have been avoided from so many scholars and Christians.</span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;" /><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;" /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Anyway, my point is this one&hellip; Revelation 2:14 points to the ones that hold Balaam&rsquo;s doctrine: who taught to eat meat sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication. In my head was clear that Paul did teach about eating meat sacrificed to idols but I was not clear about the fornication statement. [J then explains his proofs Paul permitted fornication, as defined in Bible.]&nbsp;Thus, here it is. Paul revealed as the Balaam mentioned in Revelation (Philippians 1:5; 4.10-20).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">&nbsp;I don't understand why evangelicals feel a need to harmonize Paul and Jesus. I've been researching the Paul problem for about three years. &nbsp;I feel that if early Christian churches didn't all have Paul's letters and were still Christians that Christians today don't have to follow Paul to be a Christian. I think it's more important to follow the way of the Master: Jesus. (M 2/3/2013)</span></p>

But when I do [read Paul], I see the wolf plain as day. He starts nice and kind, and that is the sheep. But as the wolf he inserts words that are oh so clear to me now: don't obey the Law. That is obviously Paul's goal.</span></div>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I must say, we have been looking for this very information for a very long time. I'll be as brief as possible. Six years ago after failing miserably as a non-believer of Jesus Christ, I began attending church as a &ldquo;good&rdquo; Christian should, but as time progressed I felt to say the least; very empty, as though something was amiss. That is when my marvelous and sometimes frightening journey began. At this stage I was still dibbling and dabbling at scripture and not anything like the Bereans, I wanted to believe everything the pastors, minister (what ever they refer to themselves these days) said, partly because they were obviously far more educated in this field and hopefully men of God; why otherwise would they be doing this if that was not the case? I was about to learn a very, very valuable lesson. Now, whilst studying the books of Moses, the first thing that struck me was the absolute firmness of God&rsquo;s Law and the one that got my attention was the fourth commandment&hellip;Remember the Sabbath. Well to say the least after two years of diligent study on this subject, I was horrified with the shallow debates and criticism of those wanting to uphold these laws; it was absolute mud-slinging! People actually trying to annul the Law of God?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I stopped going to church on Sundays and it caused some problems; the pastor, family and friends were highly upset with my decision, and worried. Many tried to convince me (at the time, even my husband) to reconsider this drastic decision. I then suggested a test&hellip;an envelope with much literature was sent with my husband on a Sunday morning. He approached our pastor before the sermon and handed him the thick package with the title &ldquo;The 4<sup>th</sup> Commandment.&rdquo; He looked at it, handed it right back and replied that he neither had the time, nor the desire to read the contents. Obviously this must have laid heavily on his conscience as directly after the sermon he took my husband aside and admitted that the Sabbath is indeed on the Saturday&hellip;need I say more? Well, the same goes for Paul; something just bothered me about everything he ever wrote. I must admit though that only when I had actually read my Bible through did this become even more apparent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Have you ever seen the look on another Christians&rsquo; face when you tell them that you firmly believe Paul&rsquo;s epistles are false and contradictory to every word of Christ? To say the least I was not very popular and judging by his [Pauls&rsquo;] popularity I never will be.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Therefore, I thank you for your extensive research; it is truly much appreciated and most helpful.

I've been pouring over your materials, after recently finding your site for a different reason, and there should have been a thousand hits. I can find only one reason there wasn't. The Lord wanted me to rely solely on Him. I did. Next challenge, the dead church I found myself in, and what He had to say on this issue..When I read Rev. 2:2 I laughed and said I know who that is! When I read your page on what Jesus had to say about church structure, that experience was like you were in my head listening to what the Spirit revealed on that! Thank you so much, through clearly due diligence, so beautifully articulating what I couldn't.... &nbsp;(DB Nov 25, 2012)</span></p>

I certainly accepted Jesus as God's representative but became frustrated with the inherent contradictions between Jesus and Paul (which are amplified in the teachings of many churches and other groups). I rejected Paul about 20 years ago. (Sam 11/11/2012).</span></div>

Your book was wonderful and I appreciated it greatly, especially that it has been made available to the public for free on the net. You can not imagine how much I learned, especially when you are quoting scripture to compare what Paul taught and what Jesus had said about salvation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">[I asked God to learn about the Holy Spirit] Well, the thing is that I started taking notes of all that the Spirit was teaching me and also collecting information from other persons having any knowledge about it, and it turns out I ended up writing a book which treasured this Wonderful Person and I now know the joy of a relationship that has given everything a second wind to my life as a believer. Anyway, all this I tell you for the following reason. It was there that I began to trace the New Testament to discover who <strong><em>changed the writings and discovered that there was Paul who began teaching differently than Jesus Christ</em></strong>. And once it was in front of my computer screen with the blank page of Google, the sweet voice of the Spirit told me clearly: "Write about the contradictions of Paul," and so began my learning about this strange character and his strange doctrines which deprived us of so much truth. It was in doing so which prepared me to teach a class on 'JWO' without even knowing that your wonderful book even existed. So today I decided to contact you to tell you how much your book publication has blessed me and share with you this humble booklet I wrote after reading JWO as a way of summarizing both what were the things I already knew about it and I learned thanks to you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I'd like to thank you for all these enlightening &amp; well documented papers. Thanks a lot !! I am an Israeli follower of Yeshua and seeker of truth. Currently I live in Switzerland, and was born and grown in France. Regarding the "pauline" issue, firstly, what is written in the Epistles of Paul prevented me - for years - to believe in the Lord and in the New Testament. I found too many things contrary to what I believed is the truth. After some time and explanations by christian or messianic believers, I accepted much of their explanation of the difficult texts, without being really convinced ! I have had so hard a time with Romans and Galatians !! The main problems for me were 1. The fact that Jesus is presented as God &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. The Law of Moses is supposedly done away with -- the opposition of Law and Faith. I did succeed to adress the number 1 issue through text analysis. But for the question of the Law, I never could find satisfactory explanation to the words of Paul. For instance the one that says "the sinful passions aroused by the law" or "without the law, I could not know covetousness." This is really anti-Torah and absurd !!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Moreover, I cannot accept the idea of declaring "righteous" a person solely on his faith or beliefs. For there are so many texts in scripture that define righteousness as doing what is good in God's eyes.

The studies are based in thorough analysis of texts, as well as historical proofs. I greatly appreciate the honesty on which the subjects are treated, which already is a re-assuring evidence that you are really a seeker of truth, as I am. </span><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Sincerely &amp; gratefully, D.

I was shocked and greatly dismayed. &nbsp;I also clearly felt that he did not meet the Apostolic test given by Peter and therefore had no right to call himself an apostle. &nbsp;Personally, I believed that, although previously baptized before becoming an idolator, I needed to repent and be baptized for the remission of sin. &nbsp;So, I did so. &nbsp;I also began to see that I needed to live according to the teachings of Jesus and I always see him instructing to observe the Law and all that He commands. &nbsp;This has been helpful in my recovery (I am now 5 and 1/2 years sober.)</span></p>

Paul is not what he seems.&nbsp;I find JWO and the articles very interesting.

<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">&nbsp;My wife and I are totally on board with the findings in your Jesus Words Only book. We ask ourselves constantly how we missed seeing the truth all these years when it was hidden in plain sight.&nbsp; We tried sharing this information with our home based Bible Study group and we were literally kicked out of the group!&nbsp;&nbsp; We started out in a mega church 8 years ago of 14,000 members and now we are down to just the two of us.&nbsp; It has been difficult to share the information about Paul with any of our friends or families and are starting to feel the isolation.&nbsp; Any ideas on where we can get to know and be with others who know who Paul really is? (G 6/21/2012)</span></div>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The information presented in your book is well thought out and provoking. &nbsp;It's rather gutsy to take on an issue like this -- for years I have been taught to accept everything in the Bible as truth, yet have always been bothered by certain things:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Why don't Christians &nbsp;go to church on the Sabbath? I always like the number "7", and Sabbath always meant 7th day of the week -- so why is Church the 1st day of the week? &nbsp; I have asked leaders this again and again, and now realize I have been given an answer straight from Paul. &nbsp;I had never been satisfied. &nbsp;This issue always bugged me.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Another issue is "easy grace" which I've had many discussions with my husband. &nbsp;Jesus always said to Believe AND Repent! &nbsp;But too often people change that to "Just Believe", and leave out the repentance part of being a Christian.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Also, I always thought it queer that Paul wrote it's okay to eat meat sacrificed to idols -- it made no sense. &nbsp;But then I have also been taught that Apostle Paul was an authority figure in the New Testament, so it never occurred to me to question him.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Now it's become much &nbsp;clearer how much Paul has influenced modern Church practices and doctrine, and indeed affected my beliefs and practices. &nbsp;I had always thought a lot of focus was placed on Paul's teachings, as though he was an interpreter of Christ's teachings. &nbsp;But then -- wait a minute -- I need to get things straight from Jesus, not interpreted and twisted. &nbsp;I've come to this conclusion again and again, whenever I've strayed. &nbsp; My Church is strong in &nbsp;reading the Bible throroughly and often draws parallels between the Old Testament and New Testament, often pointing out prophecies as well. &nbsp; However, I do recall one recent sermon on "legalism" and "circumcision" when Paul vehemently defended "freedom in Christ", so now we don't have to get too legalistic.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Now I'm asking: &nbsp;Are we missing the boat completely here? &nbsp;I've been checking out the referenced Bible verses and my jaw is still dropping. &nbsp; So where do I go from here? &nbsp; I wanted to present Chapters 1, 6 and 14 to my pastor to see how he responds. &nbsp;However, I would like to consider a church that is going back to the basics Jesus preached. &nbsp;My church does a good job studying the Bible, however we meet on Sundays, and there is some reliance on Paul's teachings. &nbsp; I don't know if they would consider changing their ways based on the challenge you've given with your research and book. &nbsp;The only church I know in this area (small city in Virginia) that meets Saturdays are the 7th Day ADventists -- I don't know a lot about them. &nbsp;So what do I do? &nbsp;Now I'm getting a better idea of the "uproar" talked about in Acts with Paul preaching one thing, and the apostles teaching what they learned from Jesus.

Early this year I left that church. I began doing research and what I found, I didn't like.... I found your website, along with a few others to be very informative and very to the point. The churches I had the msifortune to attend not only push the Pauline doctrine, but also they manage to take that doctrine and twist it even further. I have also noted striking similarities between Paul and people like, oh say...Benny Hinn (none of his 'prophecies" have come to pass), Ken Hagin, Ken Copeland and even a preacher at a church I attended. They all seem to have 'revelations' allegedly from Jesus that were never spoken by him in any of the gospels. I have found that these "words from God" or "Revelations from Jesus" to be in direct contradiction to Jesus' teachings. They all seem to have a new 'word'.&nbsp;For years I have said that if Yeshua were to return today, he would not recognize his church.' As far as money goes, I think I'll keep sending it to organizations on the reservations that feed, clothe and warm the poor.&nbsp;Thank You for your eye opening work.&nbsp;Respectfully.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">For me (still hungry and praying for the TRUTH for about 30 years) the revelation that Paul came in his own name, preaching 'another gospel', and was NOT appointed or approved as a disciple of Jesus, and because Paul did not continue in Jesus word, and that Paul sowed the tares of deception right into the word of God that a powerful delusion would be delivered to deceive even the elect, if that were possible.... is STILL OVERWHELMING to me, but now so obvious, as well.

Thank you so much for taking the time, and interest in this much needed subject. &nbsp;By the way, your book is easy to read, not hard for anyone who has an ear! &nbsp;All your end notes are incredible with so much research with HEART! Thank You! Blessings in Messiah Y'shua, (Chelsea C. May 15, 2011)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Dear Mr.....We have ordered additional copies of your books because my dear siblings (four) have all fallen prey to the teachings of Paul. &nbsp;We all grew up keeping God's commandments and believing them to be very important. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the Pastor of their church, after many years of allowing other doctrines to influence his beliefs, has decided to come out of the closet and do away with the Sabbath. He has joined all the other denominations around us and will now be holding Sunday service. &nbsp;To make matters worse, the first Sunday service was this past week for Easter Sunday! &nbsp;He is now more defiant than ever and has completely embraced the "freedom in Christ" ideology and has made it very clear that he will no longer be kept in bondage under the law. &nbsp;Just as your book on Paul explains, they will hate the teaching of one master and embrace the other. My mother has already been called into the "office" and has been asked to stop confusing the flock! Teaching truth is now being labeled as confusing and divisive!&nbsp;My mother has also tried approaching my siblings several times and unfortunately, all they can do is quote Paul. &nbsp;It has grieved my mother and myself very much. &nbsp;We are praying about this daily and asking God for mercy and revelation. &nbsp;We also prayed over your books before handing them off to my brother (one sibling at a time). &nbsp;More than ever, we now understand that their eternal life is at stake. Please help us to pray. &nbsp;You don't know how many eyes are being opened to the truth - we pray our siblings will one day soon join that list. Thank you. &nbsp;May the Holy One of Israel greatly bless you. (Liz April 27, 2011.)</span></p>

I'm writing to thank you, ask questions, and offer a small measure of critique.&nbsp;Thank you for bringing to larger Christendom an issue that has apparently been simmering for centuries. It looks like beyond you and Eisman no one else is talking about this. We have been shocked,&nbsp;saddened and just plain flabbergasted by the common-sense-based, logical and well-documented information on your website. We feel somewhat betrayed (Why haven't we heard this before?) and yet somewhat affirmed and relieved (My wife always thought Paul was unnecessarily belligerent and manipulative and I've said for 20 years that "sola fide" was a heresy -- based on James and the Sheep &amp; the Goats). Most affirming was chapter 16, in which we learn Paul has been kept in his place for most of life of the Church (and by implication can go back to that lesser place again).&nbsp;I appreciate your gentle and humble attitude in dealing with your critics -- you refute them by logic and Scripture, despite their personal attacks. It seems you really know your struggle is not against them as people and believers, but against the false pretensions which have blinded them and so many of us for so long.&nbsp;I appreciate your goal to get this information out above the goals to make a profit or a name (which are of course yours to make). But when I see the book available on your site for free, and your name nearly&nbsp;hidden on your site, it preemptively removes any thought that you may have baser motives.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I stumbled upon this site after doing a Google search of "Jesus's words". &nbsp;As someone who grew up in the church, memorizing scripture at an early age, attending all of the vacation bible schools and summer "mission" camps as a teenager, I have lately become worried that I have somehow fallen from grace by not wanting to go to church every Sunday morning. &nbsp;There are things I see now that I didn't see as a child, and the pomp and frills that go into the political parade seen every Sunday morning is no longer for me. &nbsp;I simply have lost all passion to do the Sunday morning shuffle and greet the neighbor next to me. &nbsp;On the other hand, I have never lost my faith, and in fact any time I read Jesus's words in the New Testament, I am suddenly alive again. It comforts me knowing that if Jesus were among the flesh today, the last place He would likely be seen would be the five-story churches with 2,000 members, escalator, and coffee shops. &nbsp;Our Teacher taught love and humility, yet all I seem to find in the church is vanity and gossip. Needless to say, this website is exactly what I needed to find. &nbsp;I have only read a few passages and articles, but it's unbelievably refreshing to see how studying the Bible with a focus on His words can be like reading an entirely different, more meaningful book. Many, many thanks. (Jacob Oct. 18, 2010.)</span></p>

I sat for about 3 hours printing off<em> JWO</em> to take to my friends so they could read it. That prompted the order of 6 books to share and study. (Mary 1/19/2010).</span></p>

Greetings from the State of Washington....I wanted to digest your book - <em>Jesus Words Only</em> - which I have found is incredibly profound. It has changed my whole life. I must admit that your book is counted among my most favorite. (Walter 1/19/2010)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">As I searched&nbsp; the internet (Google)&nbsp; I came across something that I thought my eyes were deceiving me &ndash; <em>Jesus Words Only</em> &ndash; those words jumped off the screen and I thought this was just so awesome!&nbsp; The very thing I needed to see and here it was in front of me &ndash; how gracious and true God is! ...As I studied this book online, the blessings which flowed were more than I could put into words &ndash; to think that He loves us so much and knows exactly when and how to satisfy the longing of our hearts!&nbsp; I cannot thank Doug enough for this insightful work, which he has so beautifully put together &ndash; and the courage it took to write such profound things...so many questions were answered and so many fears were laid to rest&hellip; after all, now I have discovered the very deception within the place I had sought to find my God! ...The Good Shepherd had found me and brought me to that gate and I had to make the choice &ndash; go through or turn and go back&hellip;. Doug&rsquo;s Jesus Words Only spoke straight to my heart and I drank, and drank and as I did so, knew that chains were falling off me.... The sheer joy of being free of much deception and discovering the wonder of Yahushua/Jesus&rsquo; Words&nbsp; has changed my life forever. We really do not need the words of Paul. He is the one who was so totally confused, as he brought his own gospel and threw the True Gospel out....The true ravening wolf dressed in sheep's clothing. In these last days, I know that eyes are being opened and &lsquo;HE WHO HAS EARS TO HEAR, LET HIM HEAR&rsquo;!!! My prayer is that MANY will be set free from the terrible deception within Christianity and will come to know the ONLY True Gospel &ndash; Jesus Words Only will become&nbsp; to them Life and a narrow Way which leads to peaceful pastures.

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Firstly, let me say that I am so happy for the work you have done. I use your book all the time as a reference and have been trying to help in bringing the sheep back into the fold of Yeshua's words alone! This is very difficult and most times I am accused of being a heretic or worse. I cannot fathom how one can accuse me of these things when I adhere strictly to Yeshua's teachings! Why do they love Paul so much?....(Ryan 12/1/09).</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Truly, I have no real issues with Paul ... but I believe we must get back to Jesus' words and stop using Paul as a filter, because it really is starting to get on my nerves. Makes me wonder why Jesus spent time with twelve students, if he wanted a special one to the Gentiles.&nbsp; Ultradispensationalism and Marcionism almost seem to be the same thing to me. Nothing new under the sun. Keep up the good word. Christendom needs it. (Fol. 10/19/09)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I'd just like to add that&nbsp;<em>Jesus' Words Only</em> is the most insightful book I've read&nbsp;since C.S. Lewis' <em>Mere Christianity</em>. (J. 10/4/09)</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I can not say enough by way of thank you for your most brilliant book -- <em>Jesus' Words Only</em>. In my youth I began to feel that Paul was not from God, and that was in the 1950&rsquo;s. Your excellent ability to research your topic and then produce clear, understandable writing is a valuable tool to enlighten many; thank you for all your labors. Thank you even more for taking Christ&rsquo;s side against those who would sideline His ministry. I know full well your efforts to stand with Him have been costly in terms of ridicule and rejection. What a breath of fresh air to read your book....We too have been studying this and ... so your writing will be class material for some Sabbaths to come. (Michael L. 10/11/09).</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Thank for doing this.&nbsp; It helps me understand my frustration in the Bible and the varying words of Jesus vs Paul's words. My friend and I have had discussions and we always have a problem getting through Paul's words and how they were different than what Jesus said. Thank you for pointing all this out. (Elizabeth 10/13/09)</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I read part of your e-book and I am beginning to understand what you are saying about Paul. I was interested in the Messianic movement, and have searched far and wide seeing if any objective scholar could read a pro-torah Paul but to no avail. I rarely have anything against him, and growing up, I always saw him as a wonderful testimony from God, who went from adversary to ally, and found his involvement in the NT to be amazing. Lately, with the fact that the OT, the other epistles and even the sermon on the mount are ignored because of Paul, I have really begun to wonder about Paul. Seeing your point, I wonder if there is anything positive we can take from the Pauline letters. There are some good things like the running a race, the armor of Christ and the fruits of the spirit which I liked. Is it wise to take the good from him or is it better to ignore him altogether? I have considered putting him in the backseat of the NT for now, until I figure out the value....From the way Paul has almost taken over from the Messiah and his twelve, I believe it best for me to understand Jesus better. Thank you for what you are doing, by redirecting us towards Jesus's words again. (Fol. 10/18/09)</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Thank you for publishing Jesus' Words website. The ravening wolf prophecy linked to Paul was an eye opener and I now believe that Paul was a false apostle and is the one mentioned in the Book of Revelation: "I know your works, your labor, and your patience, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. And you have tested those who SAY THEY ARE APOSTLES and are not, and have found them liars." Rev. 2:2 (Tom 9/23/09).</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I would like to thank you for having the courage to write the book "Jesus' Words Only" and for making it available free online.&nbsp; I downloaded it and had the pages printed and bound at a shop -- it cost me more than the price of the book but it is totally worth it....I am so convinced of the truth that I put a link to your website [on my personal webpage]. Since then, I have been persecuted by two friends who think I have been deceived. Isn&rsquo;t it strange that people take so much offense when Paul is being attacked in defence of Jesus? I know I have already been labelled as a believer of heresy and will be persecuted by many other people, but no matter what, I will stand by what I believe is God&rsquo;s truth and light....The fact that you have made your brilliant book available free online is a clear indication that you are not one of those false prophets who are driven by greed.&nbsp; Thank you again.

I have printed a few chapters and placed them in a binder. They are deep and take time to sort out. It concerns me "why" people reject the words of the Messiah.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Well, so far I have read all&nbsp;the chapters of the online edition of JWO....At this point what I can say is your thesis is very&nbsp;lucid, intelligent&nbsp;and thought provoking. Your arguments are clear and concise, extremely persuasive, well grounded in scripture documentation&nbsp;and very well presented. In short I think&nbsp;you are an excellent writer and your book&nbsp;will be the standard for the JWO argument. I am having a hard time believing that I, a Christian for 40 years, am just now seeing others expound on something&nbsp;that has bothered me all these years&nbsp;but I couldn't put my finger on it.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I took a quick look at <em>Jesus Words Only</em>. Yes, by all means, Paul must be compared with Jesus. That way, as you (and I) point out, Paul does come out significantly different from Jesus. A false prophet, as you point out so dramatically....[It] is interesting to see how our researches have dovetailed....It is important to both of us to liberate Jesus' message from that of Paul. (Barrie Wilson, Professor of Religious Studies at Toronto's York University, author of <em>How Jesus Became A Christian</em> (2009).)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I found your website listed at www.yahuah.org and it became one of my favorites very quickly.

I thank you very much for your good work. (Abraham 5/29/2009).</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I am very glad that I found your site! You echoed the same thoughts and problems that I myself have had with Paul. I am a chaplain candidate with the US Army and a graduate of an evangelical university. I really ran into problems with Paul in Seminary in preparation for my ascension to become a full chaplain, but I just could not see how someone could take Paul's words and form them to echo what Christ said and what all the other apostles wrote. It seemed like too much of a jump to me to believe Paul. Finally after a few of the professors grew tired of me constantly questioning them concerning Paul, and not being satisfied with "well tradition states..." one decided to pull me aside and ask me was I sure I was meant to be a chaplain, after all, how could I question the father of modern Christianity! I am so glad to see that I am not alone! I was beginning to believe that I was a heretic, but I could not force myself to just believe because someone else told me I should...I wanted answers to my questions and you gave them, thank you! ....Again, thank you for lifting this weight off of my chest, I dont feel like such a heretic after all....(K 2/7/2009).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I must admit, I'm impressed. My mind has been blown on a few occasions while reading the book online. The evidence against Paul seems overwhelming. YHWH Bless. (Sebastien Dec.08.)</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">First of all, thank you very much for putting your book Jesus' Words Only online.&nbsp; I've been reading it non-stop each night, and manage to turn off the computer only at the point of bare exhaustion. .. JWO has been so uplifting to me and has actually helped me to live a better life.&nbsp; For a long time I have questioned Paul's legitimacy as an&nbsp; apostle of Jesus....Your book has changed my attitude toward sin.&nbsp; Before, I had the "once saved, always saved" attitude that I could continue to commit sins and that if I repented later they would be forgiven.&nbsp; In reality, I fooled myself into thinking I could sin with impunity, and I never really repented for any of my sins.&nbsp; Deep down I knew that I was making a mockery of God's forgiveness and long suffering mercy.&nbsp; Furthermore, I knew that I was not fooling Him in the least.&nbsp; In my old belief, there was never any fear of punishment to keep me from sinning, since I believed I was eternally saved.&nbsp; Under that old belief, I continued to sin, always fearing in my mind that was dead wrong, but never knowing for sure. But now, your book helped me to focus on the teaching of Jesus alone, without Paul's confusion of the gospel.&nbsp; Now I realize that I am saved, but that being saved, I am also a branch of the vine Jesus.&nbsp; I am required to produce fruit or risk being hewn down and cast into the fire.&nbsp; To me that says salvation is not a permanent thing, and can be taken away.

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Your book on Paul was given to me by a friend that I just recently met and it has been instrumental in our being able to reach others with this very important message. &nbsp;Having been a Baptist missionary and a pastor for a number of years, I don't have to tell you what my mindset was for most of my life. However, a few years ago I began having problems with what I was seeing in the Bible and what I was preaching so I left the church and started searching....It is difficult to find fellowship with like minded believers but there are a few of us and we enjoy studying and midrashing the Scriptures together Again I thank you for your incredible work and your taking time to respond. &nbsp;May Yah richly bless you as you continue your invaluable work.

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Just wanted to thank you for your tremendous amount of work involved in the writing of your book concerning Paul. &nbsp;I have had trouble for years with the teachings of Paul but since I have been taught all my life including seminary that we dare not question the canonicity of the New Testament writings I had to somehow reconcile in my mind to obvious contradictions between the teachings of Yeshua and Paul. Your book sorted out a lot of things for me including the matter of canon. &nbsp;After having read through the book and going back through it and checking references and documentation, I have the answers I have been seeking and the freedom to begin to think for myself. Again I thank you very much...May Yah bless you in your life and ministry. Sincerely in the Faith. (John 11/13/08)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I would like to thank you for your book &ldquo;Jesus&rsquo; Words Only." &nbsp;I bought several copies of it in late 2005 and gave them to friends and family.&nbsp; Although I don&rsquo;t fully agree with all you have to say, I can certainly say that your book has been one of the most thought provoking ones I have every read, and reread. &nbsp;I greatly appreciate the work you have done and the courage it has taken... Throughout all my years of teaching I have always had problems with Paul and as discussions would lead to differences I would often state: &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I am a Christian, not a Paulian, so I&rsquo;ll follow what Jesus teaches on the issue.&rdquo;... Your books have excellent thoughts and will help shape our discussions and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I have really come to appreciate your find on Trophimus. His having been busted for defiling the Temple is certainly implied by Luke. And knowing what Paul taught the Ephesians in 2:14-22 explains Trophimus' state of mind and actions perfectly. His defense would have been, "But Paul said..." and this perfectly explains the reaction of those who cried out for help against Paul in the Temple. It's one of those things where when you finally see it, you wonder how you missed it for so long! I was just showing my wife Lisa this just last night and she too was fascinated. ...I'm reading the entire book through again. I've gotten through chapter 3 so far and it is basically the same as the first edition, but I still get such a thrill reading it again because I can't see where anyone can come up with a good argument to refute your logic. You have all the bases covered so well. (Scott N. March 12, 2007)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">[From a Jewish friend.] Dear Doug, Thanks for your book. I actually made about four trips to the web site to read it. ...I read over one half of your book this weekend. I haven't perused it line-by-line yet. It would take me hours to do your effort justice. My only fear is that you will be branded a heretic. Most Rabbis I know and have read have always been kind and understanding of Jesus and what he said -- his ministry. I have found few Jews who have the same patience with Paul. My own views of the Messiah have evolved and are too complex for an e-mail, or even a letter. Most Christians and Jews would characterize me as a heretic on this point. At least they'd shoot me&nbsp;before they shot you...Your primary thesis is that where there is a conflict between Jesus and Paul, the benefit of any doubt should go to Jesus.The Church, as an institution, has a different history. I suspect this is because Paul was at least four things: (1) a prolific writer, (2) very persuasive, (3) very passionate, and (4) lucky enough to have his writing survive. I love your theme of returning to the law. My own observation is that we live in a largely lawless world where a passion for truth and justice could only improve the lot of all humanity. I could spend many more hours in this dialogue. And we will. Sooner or later you will visit me for an extended visit in Cambria or I in Orange County. (Clint Jan. 2006)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Halleluyah - for this most enlightening, comprehensive, educative, courageous and brilliant book! It not only exposes the falsity of Paul as an apostle of Yah'shuah, but teaches on a whole host of fundamental principles with respect to following Yahweh and only Yahweh's words (Matthew 4:4). Yahweh richly bless you for this great work, which should strengthen weak followers of Yah'shuah. (Isaac, Dec. 21, 2005)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Is Paul the Apostle really who he claimed to be? Or is he a false prophet whose writings should be excluded from the New Testament? The Attorney author deftly argues his case in the book Jesus&rsquo; Words Only &ndash; Or Was Paul the Apostle Jesus Condemns in Revelation 2:2?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">A self-proclaimed &ldquo;evangelical Christian&rdquo; since age 15, the author informs readers in the book&rsquo;s introduction that his soul-searching began as a result of questioning the Baptist doctrine of eternal security and the Calvinist doctrine of perseverance of the saints. After searching for answers, T was frustrated to find that although these teachings always originated with Paul, Jesus&rsquo; words seemed to contradict Paul&rsquo;s. Irritated at what appeared to be an &ldquo;incessant marginalization of Jesus in preference for Paul,&rdquo; the author asks and seeks to answer the controversial question: &ldquo;Why not Jesus&rsquo; words alone?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">A practicing attorney, the author's obvious skill for in-depth research and proficient prosecution is evident, as he lays down argument after argument to support his verdict: Paul is guilty of being a false prophet, and therefore, his writings should not be included in the New Testament. First, the author says, Paul never made a valid prophecy, which is the only way a true prophet could add text to the Bible (Deut. 18:15). Second, the writings of Paul negate the law, which the author says is clear evidence that he was a false prophet (Deut. 13:5). Third, the author points out that Jesus&rsquo; mention of Balaam in Revelation 2:14 points to Paul as the Balaam-type figure in the New Testament church. (Balaam was an Old Testament prophet who taught that eating meat sacrificed to idols is permissible, as did Paul.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">T uses evidence from both early Church History and scripture to weave a convincing case against Paul, although Paulinists would argue that there are numerous holes in his theory. The majority of evangelical Christians will most likely find the author&rsquo;s charges heresy, saying that God would not allow his Word to be tainted in such a manner (the author even offers an answer for this). For the author and his claims, however, the jury is still out, and his book is food for thought for those who are serious students of the Bible. (BookWire Review May 30, 2006)</span></p>

An excellent book if you have ever wondered why Paul's epistles (writings) seem to speak in a kind of double talk. He was only a man, and not one of the 12 Apostles, so we may have to decide that his writings are for edification, not for inspiration, as we accept the writings of the Old Covenant and the words of the 12 apostles before his. We are blind if we follow man (like we do Paul with what he says, especially when he contradicts what YAHSHUA says) because we must check everything told to us and be like the Bereans who were deemed righteous because they checked everything. We must study to show ourselves approved.</span><br style="color: #111111; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">YAHWEH and YAHSHUA are all in all, not Paul!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">This book is worth reading and studying!!!

<p><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; line-height: 19px;">5 years ago I started questioning Paul's writings and wondering why do we even need him?</span><br style="color: #111111; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" /><br style="color: #111111; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; line-height: 19px;">I was then studying more astutely the Torah and loved it..So why do we not DO TORAH as a whole? and why are we divided as a people, calling ourselves "Christians" instead of falling under one umbrella with the Hebrews that follow Torah? So many questions now...so I wanted to</span><br style="color: #111111; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; line-height: 19px;">study ONLY the Words of Yeshua...so I found this book online and purchased it.

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">&nbsp;<span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">The very title of this extraordinary book "Jesus' Words Only" is precisely why I choose to buy it. After my own research&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">of studying the Torah (5 books of Moses: Genesis- Deuteronomy) and then the prophets of the Old Testament for several&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">years then delving into the New Testament with better background, I immediately started to see why we are so divided&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">as a Church of Yahshua. Paul was arrogant, self-serving, his two witnesses were never named, and the list continued.</span></span><br style="color: #111111; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" /><br style="color: #111111; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; line-height: 19px;">This book sat on the shelf, unread, for 4 years or more. My question: WHY do we always use Paul's words over Jesus'?</span><br style="color: #111111; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">Shouldn't it be the other way around? To my thinking...why do we even need the boastful Paul? Sure his words are fluffy,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">puffy, tickle your ears with warm fuzzies cute sometimes..but our God is not like Paul's God.</span></span><br style="color: #111111; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" /><br style="color: #111111; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">Once I opened this book up...I've never been able to put it down for long..It is very logical in thought and precise in execution&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">of facts. The author has more than the two witnesses needed on each topic of analyzing the words of scripture and pointing out&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">our neglect as members of the body of Christ to follow the Words of God in Deut. telling us to TEST anyone claiming to be from&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">HIM! It is our duty to TEST everything according to the TORAH!

Only 12 apostles will sit to judge the 12 Tribes of Israel as Revelation concludes. Matthias was&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">choosen by the original apostles with the criteria that that apostle be a living witness of Jesus' teachings as well&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">as live by all those teachings.

WAY, WAY too many holes in Paul's personality to ever&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #111111; line-height: 19px;">think him a Holy Apostle worthy of such an honor or even capable of such a task to rightfully judge any of the tribes of Israel.</span></span><br style="color: #111111; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" /><br style="color: #111111; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; line-height: 19px;">Do not think the scriptures are INFALLIBLE and somehow God has taken us from that duty to TEST those that claim&nbsp;to speak for God.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Having concentrated only on the teachings of Jesus for several years, DT's book gave legs to the variances I've noted from Paul that were in opposition to the doctrine of God as taught by Jesus. Of all things we've considered Scripture, "Jesus' Words Only" lays out the case, point by point, that what we have considered Scripture and assumed to be from a messenger of God cannot be true. In fact, the book shows Paul to have been heretical by the first century Church. The evidence is thoughtfully brought forward that should be convincing to anyone who as been disturbed by inconsistent doctrines in the New Testament. If we have the courage to stand up and believe what Jesus said is true and are also careful to note the warnings from the twelve apostles of record, there is no other sound conclusion than to reject Paul as the Balaam of the New Testament because he taught people to disregard the gospel as preached by Jesus and the twelve.</span><br style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: normal;" /><br style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: normal;" /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The negative comments on the book based upon one experts opinion VS another only confuses the issue. The real issue is if Jesus spoke the words verily from the Father in Heaven directly - and He said we will all be judged by His words - then what Paul said doesn't matter. If we believe Paul heard Jesus somewhere else, then what was the point of His choosing twelve disciples and then directing them to make disciple of Him, immerse them into the Name (FSH), and teach them to keep the same commandments He had already given to them? Then later we also see the testimony of Jesus from heaven to continue upholding what He already said, and commending those at Ephesus for testing those who claimed to be an apostle but were not. Of the seven Churches, Ephesus is the only one where we know Paul was active, and as Paul admits in 2 Tim. 4, he had a first defense (trial?) and that ALL the brethren in Asia abandoned him.

I found Mr. DT's book to be an excellent source of information, very well written, and of enormous help to me as a thinking Christian. He managed to put into words, with wonderfully supported and researched arguments, <em><strong>what I had sensed but did not myself have the expertise to articulate</strong></em>. I recommend the book whole heartedly. I personally believe that all people of faith should read this book. <em><strong>Paul has distorted the teachings of Jesus to a degree that may, if you take his words over Jesus', put your very soul in peril</strong></em>. There is a broad and a narrow path, according to Jesus, and if you care about your soul, you may want to do some research to ensure you are on the narrow one.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">After reading this book I have a new understanding of the Early Christian faith. DT clearly demonstrates through extensive research and knowledgeable sources of how the Christian faith was vastly different in the early christian church and how Paul's doctrine was disgarded for the words of JWO. It wasn't until the Government of Rome discovered the potential of ultimate power by combining religion and politics using Paul's words did Christianity change forever. I have been to Bible college and grown up in a non-denominational church for 32 years and can plainly see the different and contradictory doctrines that Paul introduced to the world but <em><strong>I never could put my finger on it before because my Pastor always read Jesus's words through Paul's epistles instead of the other way around</strong></em> and then wrapped everything up in a nice bowtie with dispensational theology. The one thing that stood out to me from reading JWO was that there was indeed a very large disagreement between Paul and the apostles James and Peter. This is not spoken of in the modern church today for good reason because if more people were focused on that then immediate questions would have to be answered. For one, what were the disagreements about? Who had the ultimate leadership over Jews and gentiles and so forth. <em><strong>People are content to not question why Paul never mentions Jesus's words</strong></em>, why didn't Paul study with the disciples after he got saved, why if God told him his ministry was to be ministering to the Gentiles did he immediately go to the Jews and try to witness to them and was rejected? Why did Paul's Damascus conversion testimony change so dramatically in his epistles and for what reason? Why did he get rejected by all of Asia and most importantly, <em><strong>was Jesus's Prophecy of the coming of the false Apostle from the tribe of Benjamin about Paul who happened to be from that tribe</strong></em>? Modern day christians are content with the "cheap grace" that Bonhoeffer talked about in his book <em>The cost of discipleship</em> which I've just ordered btw because they've never heard a contradicting viewpoint, until now. The one thing that rings true in my heart though, is that Jesus commanded us to search the scriptures for ourselves and not just blindly accept what's handed to us. One thing I always heard growing up is that EVERYTHING in the Bible is 100% inspired and don't question anything. However, if Jesus commanded us to test the scriptures against his words, then <em><strong>why would he introduce new doctrine from Paul without foretelling of it?</strong></em> Really there is <em><strong>no difference with Joseph Smith that started the Mormon denomination and the Apostle Paul minus 2000 years imho.</strong></em> I would encourage anyone that has sat in the pew for years and had a "wait a min." moment about Paul's teachings but just stored it away to grab this book and do your own research like I did. When you do, you'll see that without Paul's alternate teachings, we are left with a faith without theology and our left with a grand commission to show Jesus's love to the world. With Paul's teachings we are left with self righteousness, hypocritical, money centered and a do nothing faith...look around, isn't that what the church looks like today? Maybe that was Satan's plan all along. I pray for God to give you discernment and wisdom so that the Holy Spirit can guide you in all understanding. God Bless DT for being used by God to write this timely book!

In my opinion this author does a great job explaining that Saint Paul is a false prophet, how Saint Paul contradicts Jesus in many occasions, how his epistles are not the word of God, and how their long acceptance is not an obstacle for their rejection in our times. He presents many prophecies from the Bible about Saint Paul, and he explains in a very simple manner many historical testimonies from the early Christian Church that are in accordance with these truths.

This is an excellent book written by a noted attorney and very gifted Bible scholar. The author knows more about the Bible, undiscovered prophecies, various manuscripts, Greek and Hebrew then most all of the pastors out there today. I have met several times for lunch with the author to compare our findings and proofs about the false apostle Paul. His book also confirms much of my findings against the false apostle Paul. The author is very Biblically sharp but what makes this Biblical genius so scary is that he is a very humble person. Many times gifted intellects can be very arrogant. The author is very kind and humble to talk with. Also see his website by the same name of his book Jesus WordsOnly.com. He exposes Paul as the prophesized Benjamite wolf prophecy and also exposes Paul as many other types and shadows of other bad characters found in the Bible.

If everyone wants to continue to hang on to Paul... I would refer them to what Christ says in Matt. 7 about the surprises many will face on judgement day. Paul will not be there to defend you when you stand before the Messiah, so I would encourage anyone who considers themself to be a Christian to cling to Christ, and not the self proclaimed 13th apostle.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">After years of "Christian" ministry, Paul claimed &ldquo;I am a Pharisee, a son (offspring) of Pharisees&rdquo; (Acts 23:6) [Note the word "am" - present tense ]. Jesus: &ldquo;Do not think I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.&rdquo; (Matt 5:17). Paul: &ldquo;Christ.. by abolishing the law..&rdquo; (Eph 2:15). Oops! Paul says.. &ldquo;But now we are released from the Law.. we serve not under the old written code but under the new life of the Spirit&rdquo; (Romans 7:6). Compare this with &ldquo;Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law!&rdquo; (Romans 3:31). No wonder there are such radical contradictions between Paul's teachings and those of Jesus. See the two life-changing books "Jesus' Words Only" and "Jesus' Words on Salvation."

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The premise of this book is to show that Paul is an apostate, that he may have been a true follower of Jesus but that he turned away. He contends that though Paul may have had a true experience with Jesus on the road to Damascus he was not an apostle, but Paul declared himself an apostle. His comparison of Paul with Balaam is interesting, as well as the explanation of knowing a prophet or apostle by their message, not by the signs and wonders. He make some miss steps in his arguments but the underlining premise is a good one.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Jesus' Words Only is essential reading for all sincere Christians. The idea that Paul teaches a different gospel than Jesus Christ sounds almost blasphemous on the surface. However the author hammers away at his points until it becomes apparent that a rebuttal is all but impossible. Does Paul declare himself a thirteenth apostle? Did anyone other than Paul give Paul his authority? Did Paul negate the law's further applicability? If Paul's words disagree with Jesus, who should we follow? You need to read this book.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">"Jesus' Words Only" was a decent read. The premise of Paul being the false apostle is correct, but the author does not use evidence that is as strong as he could have. The high point of the book was the explanation of "Balaam" in Revelation 2:14. Aside from all of that, Tondo crosses himself a few times in his explanation. He says at one point, correctly, that adding to or taking away from the Law is a sin, and would make someone a false prophet. But, he then goes on to claim that Jesus in Matthew 15 and Mark 7 is saying that eating non-kosher food is ok (thus a violation of the criteria he used against Paul), instead of explaining that Jesus was speaking about rabbinic tradition. Good premise, but overall the book was lacking. Due to the nonexistence of literature relating to this subject, it wouldn't hurt to pick this one up.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">An indictment of Pauline Dispensationalism. This book is an outstanding addition to the growing awareness among scholars and historians that there is something fundamentally wrong with the doctrine of the self-professed apostle Paul as it relates to other New Testament and Old Testament doctrine. Mr. T's trenchant analysis of Paul's incompatibility with the teachings of Jesus also exposes dispensationalist doctrine as the fraud it truly is when it futilely and superficially attempts to overcome the contradictions between Jesus and Paul by assigning each doctrine to a separate and compartmentalized "church age" or "dispensation".&nbsp; (December 22, 2006 Excaliburton at<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QKJ3DVNF4IBF/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R2QKJ3DVNF4IBF"> Amazon</a>.)</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Scott Nelson's Review</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Here is a book that I hope will be causing a major uproar in Christianity in the days to come. Its writing is literally centuries overdue. The author [is], a professional attorney, revives the nearly 2000-year-old cold case against Paul's supposed apostleship and his unique anti-Law-of-Moses doctrine....Mr. T picks up where we were cut off from history. In his case against Paul, there is no stone left unturned, and no argument in support of Paul's supposed apostleship that is left un-addressed. The author exposes the fact that Paul's claim of apostleship was taken presumptuously and went unrecognized by the 12 apostles that the Lord had specifically chosen and trained for over three years to be his official witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Mr. T accurately displays the gross differences in the teachings and doctrines of Paul over that of the Lord. He also goes on to make the solid case that it was Paul who Yahshua (Jesus) referred to when he spoke to the Ephesian church as recorded by the apostle John in Revelation 2:2. Here, Yahshua commended the Ephesians for rejecting someone who had claimed to be his apostle and was not. This is something I have also taught since the beginning of my site over ten year ago.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Mr. T also handles this case very thoughtfully and realistically and does not go off into wild accusations of conspiracy on Paul's part. His position is the same as mine in that we both believe Paul had a real conversion experience on the road to Damascus, but he was never commissioned to be an apostle. Because of his pride, Paul went very wrong. Mr. Tondo beautifully demonstrates the parallels between Paul and Balaam, a prophet who was also on his way to curse God's people when he was confronted by heavenly vision. Balaam converted and spoke much good for a while, but then went terribly wrong. If it can happen to Balaam, and numerous others, why not Paul?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Mr. T makes many additional excellent points that tie it all together into a masterful prosecution that would stand up in court today. I dare say no impartial juror would consider acquitting Paul after hearing Doug's case. On a couple of occasions while reading this book, I thought Mr. &nbsp;was getting out on a limb with what I considered a tenuous new argument only to find that after staying with him a little longer, he pulled it all together with other facts that proved his point. </span><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">If you have ever had any doubts about something Paul said, this book is a must-read for you. By the end of it, you too will agree that the only words in the NT that should be elevated to the status if "Infallible Word of God" are the words of Yahshua (Jesus) alone, and all others must comply with his teaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I very highly recommend this book to anyone, especially if you have ever had a question about Paul. I believe Mr. T's book is the very next book everyone should read right after reading the Bible. It should be required reading for every seminary student.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The scene [in Acts where Paul encounters Jesus] is very reminiscent of Balaam being stopped by the Angel of the Lord because he intended to curse Israel. The parallels between Paul and Balaam are striking. They both started out as enemies of God on their way to curse God's people when they were stopped by a blinding vision on the way. They both repented, converted and served God for a short while, then turned on Him and His people again. If it can happen to Balaam, why not Paul?&nbsp; For more details on this incredible parallel, read 'Jesus Words Only' ....http://www.judaismvschristianity.com/paula.htm</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I found this book fascinating reading. I believe it is quite likely that Shaul (Paul) was the one the Bereans were constantly checking the Scriptures (Tanakh, or "Old Testament) against to see if he was indeed teaching the truth. Whether he was a true Apostle or a false Apostle is something you will have to decide for ourself. The point is, whether he was a true apostle and greatly misunderstood, or a false apostle after the tradition of Balaam, the bottom line here is that the way Christianity understands his teaching regarding the Torah is completely against the Word of YHWH and those who align their lives by the belief that Torah was done away with need to repent and not teach this heretical doctrine! Otherwise, they may find themselves at the receiving end of the words of YHWH in Matthew 7:23.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">My copy of Tondo's book arrived a few days ago. I'm reading it with a&nbsp;mixture of shock (at my complacent assumption that Paul's letters were&nbsp;inspired scripture Just Because They're In The Canon), amazement (at the&nbsp;flat-out contradictions between Yeshua's teachings and Paul's), and&nbsp;ancticipation (at what comes next).&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, Tondo makes a case that Paul/Saul/Sha'ul/Pavlvs of Tarsus was a&nbsp;&nbsp;either a consistently false apostle or a genuine believer in Yeshua whose&nbsp;mind was subsequently corrupted a la Baalam, leading him to teach moral&nbsp;subjectivism and lawlessness on such matters as eating food sacrificed to idols, fornication, etc. (John G. Dec. 22, 2010; "<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.messianic/browse_thread/thread/cdf2588c57cdd9fd/a3ffca1d72e5749e?pli=1">Jesus Words Only" - What do you think</a>" at Messianic.net.)</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I assume you have read the book "Jesus's Words Only"? Based on the words of Yeshua, he does an absolute mincemeat job on Paul. It contains a tremendous amount of material, and is very well researched. You can download it online, but IMHO the printed copy is well worth the outlay.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Yes, I have read T's book <em>Jesus' Words Only</em> a couple of times. I have also read his book<em> Jesus' Words on Salvation</em>. Both are excellent. "Mincemeat job" is a good description of how he shreds Paul's message when compared to Jesus' words. The problem I run into when trying to explain any of this to people is the dispensation mentality. It was totally contrived to eliminate the fact that Paul's message conflicts with Yeshua's. And since Paul told them the OT is now defunct, well then, the OT rules on testing inspired expressions are also defunct. It is this type of lapse of logic that boggles my mind! They think that Yeshua would spend 3 1/2 years preaching a message that was to die when he did. It makes no sense. So, you are quite right, most people do not have any idea how to test an inspired expression to see if it is from God or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Some people just cannot stand that someone could reject their precious Paul. A year ago I was asked not to disparage Paul or leave on one forum, and about a month ago I was kicked off another site for saying that Paul was the one that might (if possible) "deceive the holy ones" that Jesus warned about. It would be almost funny if it weren't so sad. It reminded me of where people will kill off witness of Yeshua and think that they have rendered a great service. As more and more people recognise the Paul deception, I think that there will also be more opposition.&nbsp;Molly (<a href="http://www.truthseekers.co.za/index.php?option=com_fireboard&amp;Itemid=28&amp;func=view&amp;catid=3&amp;id=1000">Nov. 28, 2010</a>).</span></p>

Indeed, this is also the point in "Jesus' Words Only", which I'm about 2/3 through. It's not hard to fathom what drove Marcionism (and if Jesus's Words Only is right, Paul was Marcion's spiritual daddy). How appealing to just re-package that God into a Bad Guy who gave Bad Laws, then invent a Good Guy God who took away the Bad Laws and left us to do ... whatever might be expedient!! Whee! Now there's really no consequence for our actions (other than the bother of "inexpediency") -- provided we say (and mean, even for a split second) the Belief Formula!! Madison Avenue couldn't have packaged a slicker God than this! So, yippee! &nbsp;We're All Free.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The scene [in Acts 26 of Paul and Jesus] is very reminiscent of Balaam being stopped by the Angel of the Lord because he intended to curse Israel. The parallels between Paul and Balaam are striking. They both started out as enemies of God on their way to curse God's people when they were stopped by a blinding vision on the way. They both repented, converted and served God for a short while, then turned on Him and His people again. If it can happen to Balaam, why not Paul? For more details on this incredible parallel, read 'Jesus Words Only' by Tondo.

Researching the &nbsp;Bible even Jesus spoke against Paul as a false apostle in Revelation. You have to continue to research. I can not convince you through my words. You have to want to find the truth for yourself. I'm following God and Jesus and the before prophets that God put in place only. Go to www.jesuswordsonly.github.io to do further research. You have to find out for your self or stay closed to the truth that Jesus and God the Father made so evident. Deception is a whole lot of truth and a little bit of lie.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Just wondering if you've ever questioned the validity of Paul himself. Many doctrines that I've had difficulty with over the years (once saved always saved, the law is void/age of grace, depravity of all men, Romans 13 etc) are directly from Paul. I had these questions well before I ever doubted Paul. Upon realizing I wasn't the first to doubt Paul, I became intrigued with the possibility that he could be a false apostle. Considering many things in modern Christianity can be traced directly to him, I thought it would be worth a look. I would love to hear your opinion on the books of Mr. Tondo. I've almost made it through his book on Paul and Jesus' Words on Salvation. I now believe with my mind that Paul is false, but fully accepting it emotionally is hard as I was raised with him being a premier apostle. Anyway, I'd love maybe a refutation of some of Mr. Tondo's stuff (although it seems pretty solid to me) to further test the truth of this matter. His books can be read on his website, Jesuswordsonly.com Like your blog alot, thanks for your labor for the truth.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">My copy of <strong>Jesus Words Only</strong> arrived a few days ago. I'm reading it with a mixture of shock (at my complacent assumption that Paul's letters were inspired scripture Just Because They're In The Canon), amazement (at the flat-out contradictions between Yeshua's teachings and Paul's), and ancticipation (at what comes next). Briefly, Tondo makes a case that Paul/Saul/Sha'ul/Pavlvs of Tarsus was a either a consistently false apostle or a genuine believer in Yeshua whose mind was subsequently corrupted a la Baalam, leading him to teach moral subjectivism and lawlessness on such matters as eating food sacrificed to idols, fornication, etc.(<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.messianic/browse_thread/thread/cdf2588c57cdd9fd/a3ffca1d72e5749e?pli=1">John G. 12/22/2009</a>).</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Speaking of coming back to the text, I have been reading Jesus Words Only by Tondo. He claims that James is putting Paul on &ldquo;trial&rdquo; for his teaching on salvation as being by &ldquo;faith&rdquo; alone. He also suggests that Paul may be one of the &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; that Jesus speaks of in Revelation 2:2. This book is very intersting, but I do not know what to think at this point. One thing is certain, I know that the truth and love of God resides within Torah. Any help? (<a href="http://skipmoen.com/2009/11/15/cultural-imperatives/">John B. 11/18/2009</a>)</span></p>

In the church, from all indications, the Church has been aware of the existence of the book, from teaching for two years, Paul is against the law. Paul is quite suddenly speaking against the law. Just want to know how many people here in the end are anti-Paul? In the end how many people know this book exists?

It confirmed a lot of things that were already occupying my mind in the last year. I am NOT here to discuss whether or not Paul was a true or false aposte. I am JUST here in the hope to find someone who also has some serious doubts about Paul&rsquo;s teaching and wants to go back to JWO ('Jesus words only'). Someone who might also be wondering: What now? Hoping we can share our thoughts. (Jane&rsquo;s blog, 9/8/2008 http://www.mychurch.org/blog/2528.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The book "Jesus Words Only" is written by someone who has all of the credentials that you specify on your website for a credible bible commentator. He is an educated Evangelical Christian of many years who has the courage to admit that the epistles of Paul and the rest of the NT present two different gospels.&nbsp;You can argue that his book is just more of the James vs. Paul debate, but unless you have read this<strong><em> well documented, thoroughly researched, and compelling work</em></strong>, it cannot be dismissed out of hand. He is a trial lawyer who presents his arguments as in a legal brief, and so he forgoes the type of glib and ad hominem attacks that I have seen reading the materials on your website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Few Christians will have the courage tp o read "Jesus Words Only," and fewer still will have the courage to consider the possibility that Paul's epistles are non-canonical. Why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">1. The conclusion allows that God has not supernaturally protected the canon from inerrancy, and</span></p>

If your website does not address the most compelling arguments set forth in Jesus' Words Only, a gaping hole will result through which your own bias will be painfully obvious.

<h4><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Blogger Sir Knight Begins With Quote from Jesus&rsquo; Words Only p.295:</span></strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">After Peter founded the church of Rome and left, Paul arrived and appointed the first bishop of the church of Rome (Linus), according to Constitution of the Apostles (ca. 180-200 A.D.) at 7:46. That means Paul appointed the very first pope of Rome&mdash;although the name pope for the bishop of Rome was not yet in use. (Peter never apparently used the label bishop to identify his status at Rome.) Thus, the validity of the lineage of the Roman church depended crucially upon Paul. If Paul were discredited, it would discredit the Roman Catholic church virtually from inception.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I think that if you examine the 497 pages in "Jesus' Words Only", you will find scholarly criticism of Paul that rivals or exceeds that of Victor's work. And like Victor's book, Jesus&rsquo; Words Only is also available free online. And then some of you will be persuaded to either accept or reject the doctrine of Paul. With Paul removed from the NT, we still have the words of Jesus as recorded by his apostles and disciples, but Paul and Luke were never disciples or apostles of Jesus. They never even met Him.
