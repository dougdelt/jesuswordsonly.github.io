Paul is a problem for Jews from following Jesus.<br>

<br>


Paul is a problem for Atheists from following Jesus.<br>

<br>


Paul is a problem for Muslims from following Jesus.<br>

<br>


Paul is a problem for Deists like Jefferson from following Jesus.<br>

<br>


Paul is a problem for Christians from following Jesus.<br>

<br>


When there are so many people who would take Jesus' claims more
seriously&nbsp; BUT FOR THE PRESENCE OF PAUL in canon/doctrine,&nbsp;is
not this a good reason to critically examine why so many who profess
Christ insist on Paul's doctrines being held onto despite the
encumbrance they represent on Jesus' messsage?<br>

<br>
If you are interested to see how everyone but Pauline Christians
recognize Paul is blocking the world from accepting Jesus with His full
authority, please read this&nbsp;PDF file entitled the<a href="The%20Problem%20of%20Paul.pdf"> Problem of Paul</a>.</big></big>
