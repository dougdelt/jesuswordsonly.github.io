Christianity is not so understood; is <em><strong>not so practised; is not so preached</strong></em>:&mdash;not, with scarcely an exception, by any sect or church of Christians; that is, not consistently, not thoroughly, not by the ruling majority of any sect or church; only partially, occasionally, and by individuals. Christianity has done great things for the world, it has put down many crying evils and mitigated many more, it has produced a noble army of martyrs for truth and righteousness, it has wrought mightily in many a holy life and many a peaceful death,&mdash;<strong><em>but it has not answered Christ&rsquo;s design</em></strong>; to a great extent, and in some most important respects, it has hitherto proved a failure; its grand triumphs are yet to come; it has not purged out that leaven of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy and spiritual assumption, <strong><em>it has not made men brethren</em></strong>, it has not set the world free.</span></p>

It is not often that I think it necessary to ask your attention to the passing topics of the day, but these are matters which must interest all whom Christianity itself interests. The evils on which I have taken occasion to comment, as they have their root and origin in certain gross misconceptions of Christianity, are curable only by the exhibition of Christianity as it truly is; and it is every Christian's duty to make such a stand as his position and opportunities enable him, for that Spiritual Equality which is our religion's crowning glory.</span></p>

We call no man Rabbi. We give no man the lordship over our faith. We are equal among ourselves, we are equal as regards other churches and other sects. We do not borrow our opinions, we do not borrow [page 21] our modes of worship, from our fellow-creatures,&mdash;though it is matter of rejoicing with us that the opinions we deem to be rational, and the worship we feel to be spiritual, are participated in by many Christians and Christian churches, with whom we count it a happiness to be associated in the fellowship of a common faith.</span></p>

You ascribe not to your ministers any official, artificial sanctity&mdash;you give them not one iota of authority, temporal or spiritual. I trust you never will. But you give us more. You give us freedom. You give us the free use of our own minds, and free access to your minds. And we give you in return&mdash;what no other price could purchase of us&mdash;our real, honest thoughts on all matters within the range of the office you invest us with, leaving it to you to judge whether those thoughts be right or wrong,&mdash;assured that, whether or not you think with us, we have, and ever shall have, your kind and candid appreciation of every effort to disseminate truth and righteousness.</span></p>

Will not the voluntary efforts of voluntary unions of Christian [page 22] men, to provide instruction and moral impulse, not for themselves and their families only, but for those who need them more and feel the need less,&mdash;will not these carry forward Christian truth and virtue?

We do not want a new gospel. We want the old gospel to be preached and practised with a new energy and earnestness. We want a new perception and setting forth of its everlasting truths, a new out-pouring upon us all of its spirit of liberty and love, We want not to have Rabbis, and masters, and fathers upon earth&mdash;we want a true, living devotedness to our Master and our Father in heaven. We want not more sacraments, more priests, more bishops, more cathedral churches&mdash;we want more faith, more hope, more love. We want not government patronage, but popular intelligence and virtue. We want not the dominance of a sect, though it were our own&mdash; [page 23] but the sway of the Christianity common, more or less, to all sects, the Christianity that is known by its fruits.</span></p>

In 1552, the Anglican church removed such prayers from all official prayers. Then it changed, which explains Harwood&rsquo;s reference: &ldquo;The Anglo-Catholic movement of the 19th Century generally sought to reintroduce medieval error and ceremony including prayer for the dead and purgatory and the forebears of Church Society set themselves firmly against this perversion of the truth.&rdquo;</span></p>
