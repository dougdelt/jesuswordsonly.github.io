<h1>Jesus v. Paul -- Christianity Today Piece in December 2010</h1>
<p>In December 2010, Christianity Today allowed its readers to hear there is some question now about Paul coming from <em>within </em>Christianity. Not from enemies of Christ. But from lovers of Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2010/december/9.25.html?start=5">http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2010/december/9.25.html?start=5</a></p>

<p>We excerpt portions here below for ready reference:</p>
<h3 style="z-index: 1; font-size: 2.3em; margin: 0px; font-family: ff-milo-web, Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif; line-height: 1em; color: #231f20;">Jesus vs. Paul</h3>
<div class="deck" style="z-index: 1; color: #434343; font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 14pt; font-family: ff-milo-web, Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif; padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px;">by Scott McNight</div>
<div class="deck" style="z-index: 1; color: #434343; font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 14pt; font-family: ff-milo-web, Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif; padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px;">Many biblical scholars have noted that Jesus preached almost exclusively about the kingdom of heaven, while Paul highlighted justification by faith—and not vice versa. What gives?</div>
<div class="deck" style="z-index: 1; color: #434343; font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 14pt; font-family: ff-milo-web, Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif; padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="deck" style="z-index: 1; color: #434343; font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 14pt; font-family: ff-milo-web, Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif; padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px;">The entire New Testament comes together by answering all these questions. And the answer is Yes, Jesus preached himself as the completion of Israel's story. Jesus preached the gospel (of Paul, of Peter, of John) because Jesus preached himself. Any reading of the Gospels, and any Gospel will do, leads constantly to this question that Jesus himself asked those who saw him and heard him: "Who am I?"<br />What Jesus Thought of Jesus<br />Let's start with Jesus' teaching about the kingdom. His inaugural sermon in his hometown synagogue, at Nazareth, is a profoundly and properly egocentric statement about himself. We miss the essence of this passage if we reduce the story to kingdom only. Jesus reads from Isaiah 61:1-2, a passage about end-time kingdom redemption. But what we need to note is that Jesus thinks he is the agent of that redemption, that he is none other than the "anointed" one.<br />Another key kingdom text is Luke 7:20-23. John the Baptist asks whether or not Jesus is the "one who was to come." Jesus answers by creating a clever and beautiful mosaic from Isaiah (29:18-19; 35:5-6; 61:1). The last line is arresting in its bold claim: "Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me" (emphasis mine). In other words, Jesus claims that he fulfills those Scriptures. "The story of Israel," Jesus is saying, "comes to its completion in me." Again, the message of Jesus is thoroughly egocentric.<br />This last text leads us to a set of Gospel texts that I call the "Who am I? Who are you?" texts. In these passages, Jesus and John the Baptist are in dialogue with one another and with others about who they are. I fear we skip over these passages because we know them too well. But let me suggest we ask a question about these Jesus and John conversations: What kind of people run around asking others who they are? And when they ask such questions, do they assume that the answers are found in the persons and predictions of the Bible? Which of us says to another, "Who do you think I am? Do you think I'm the figure from Isaiah or the Messiah or Elijah or Moses or the Son of Man or the Davidic king?" None of us, and if we did, we'd be assigned to the fringes of society and perhaps institutionalized.<br />Jesus and John seemed to have carried on a conversation about who they were. And while John doesn't seem always to be certain of who he is, Jesus always is certain about both who John is and who he is.<br />(Who did others think Jesus was? Matthew 16:14. Who did others think John was? John 1:19-28. Who did John think John was? John 1:22-23. Who did John think Jesus was? Matthew 3:11-12; Luke 7:18-23. Who did Jesus think John was? Mark 9:9-13. Who did Jesus think Jesus was? Luke 7:22-23.)<br />There is something here that courses through the pages of the Gospels: Jesus and John see themselves as the ones who complete Israel's story, and their story is the saving story. (video) This is exactly what Paul said the gospel was. Jesus may have spoken of kingdom, and Paul may have spoken of justification, but underneath both kingdom and justification is Christology: It is the story about Jesus, who is Messiah and Lord and who brings the kingdom and justifies sinners by faith.<br />Excuse me for piling on here, but only when we grasp the gospel as the saving story about Jesus that completes Israel's story do we see the profound unity between Jesus and Paul. Both "gospeled" the same gospel because both told the story of Jesus. (video)</div>
<div class="deck" style="z-index: 1; color: #434343; font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 14pt; font-family: ff-milo-web, Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif; padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px;">
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">But something has happened in the past two decades: a subtle but unmistakable shift among many evangelicals from a Pauline-centered theology to a Jesus-shaped kingdom vision. Sources for this shift surely include George Eldon Ladd's&nbsp;<span class="citation" style="z-index: 1; font-style: italic;">The Presence of the Future</span>, the rugged and unrelenting justice voice of Jim Wallis, perhaps most notably in his&nbsp;<span class="citation" style="z-index: 1; font-style: italic;">Call to Conversion</span>, and a growing social conscience among evangelicals. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4pPjAl5hKg" target="_blank" style="z-index: 1; outline: none; cursor: pointer; color: #231f20; text-decoration: underline;">video</a>) We can argue about factors, but what matters is that a shift has occurred.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Daniel Kirk, a young New Testament scholar at one of Fuller Theological Seminary's extension sites, recently sent me a manuscript for review. The first suggested title was,&nbsp;<span class="citation" style="z-index: 1; font-style: italic;">Jesus Have I Loved, But Paul?</span>&nbsp;That perfectly captures something I have observed in 15 years of teaching college students. Students love the Jesus part of the class, but their eyes seem to glaze over when we move from Jesus to Paul.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">It is not exaggerating to say that evangelicalism is facing a crisis about the relationship of Jesus to Paul, and that many today are choosing sides. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-0hUrLL-Tg" target="_blank" style="z-index: 1; outline: none; cursor: pointer; color: #231f20; text-decoration: underline;">video</a>) I meet many young, thinking evangelicals whose "first language" is Jesus and the kingdom. Yet despite the trend, perhaps in reaction to it, many look to Paul and justification by faith as their first language. Those addicted to kingdom language struggle to make Paul fit, while those addicted to Paul's theological terms struggle to make Jesus fit. I know the experience because I, too, struggled to make the Pauline message fit the kingdom vision, and that was after struggling to make Jesus fit into the Pauline message.</p>
<h4 class="subhead" style="z-index: 1; line-height: normal; font-size: 1.15em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #dd3f1f; margin: 0px;">Two approaches</h4>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Evangelicals have offered two ways to resolve this dilemma—that is, to bring Paul and Jesus into a more perfect harmony. What stands out is that each approach imagines that it is articulating the gospel itself. One approach is to master Jesus' gospel, the kingdom vision, and show how Paul fits. The other approach is to master Paul's gospel, his theology of justification, and show how Jesus fits. Each approach requires some bending of corners and squeezing of sides but, with extra effort and some special explanations, each thinks it can show the unity of the messages of Jesus and Paul and that the gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of justification are one and the same.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Take the Jesus approach. The kingdom of God, if one follows George Ladd's line of thinking (often called "inaugurated eschatology"), is defined as the "dynamic reign of God." It is grounded in texts like Matthew 12:28, where Jesus says that if he casts out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has (presently) come upon them. Or Mark 1:15: the time has been fulfilled, the kingdom of God has drawn near (so near that its presence is now being felt)—therefore repent and believe. It is not hard to fit "justification by faith" into the mold of the dynamic, personal, redemptive presence of God in the work of Jesus Christ. With some careful nuancing, the witness of Romans to justification and the witness of Ephesians to a cosmic redemption in Christ can be drawn into the ambit of the kingdom.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">But a few problems always emerge. They have always given me an uneasy conscience about this kind of harmonizing. First, Paul doesn't talk about the kingdom enough to make me think his theology is really kingdom-shaped. His letters include fewer than 15 references to the kingdom. Fitting Paul into a kingdom mold is more by hook than it is by the book. Furthermore, Paul thinks more in terms of soteriology, justification, and ecclesiology than he does kingdom. So, if we are to be fair to Paul, we have to let Paul be Paul.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">An even more fatal flaw resides in this approach: kingdom means more than the "dynamic" reign of God at work in Christ. The emphasis on "dynamic" leads me to think that we evangelicals want "kingdom" to refer to the personal experience of conversion, so that it can fit with our evangelical Paul. The roadblock here is insurmountable: kingdom for any and every Jew in the first century had at least four components: a king (Jesus or God), a people (Israel), a territory (the land of Israel), and a law that governed the people (the Torah or law of Moses). My conclusion: You can't begin at kingdom with Jesus and simply cross the path and conclude that Jesus was, after all, talking about justification.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">What devastates this approach is that some of the central themes of kingdom for Jesus—which are all found in those crucial passages in Luke, such as the opening sermon in Nazareth (4:16-30)—are not found in Paul. Yes, Paul does care for the poor—of Jerusalem, at least. But caring for the poor and the outcast, and a revolutionary message about possessions—well, they just don't show up enough in Paul to lead one fairly to conclude that Paul was essentially teaching the same thing as Jesus. Kingdom and justification are not the same thing. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT6Mu5hkts4" target="_blank" style="z-index: 1; outline: none; cursor: pointer; color: #231f20; text-decoration: underline;">video</a>) We have to find a better way to harmonize Jesus and Paul.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">So others have started with Paul's understanding of justification and found a way to incorporate Jesus' kingdom vision. A recent attempt by John Piper, one of the leading lights in the revival of Reformed theology, illustrates how this can be done. At one pastor's conference, Piper asked a simple question: Did Jesus preach Paul's gospel? The order—asking if Jesus fits Paul!—might rankle many Bible readers and historians, but such questions about the Bible are not inappropriate.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">To answer this question, Piper probed the one and only time the word&nbsp;<em style="z-index: 1;">justified</em>&nbsp;in a Pauline sense appears in the Gospels. Luke 18:14 reads, "I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God." Jesus is referring, of course, to the tax collector and not to the Pharisee. We could add Matthew 12:37, and perhaps Luke 10:29 and 16:15, but we can't find much in the Gospels that shows Jesus thinking in terms of "justification by faith." But Piper's skilled exegesis and theological persuasiveness led him to conclude that Jesus&nbsp;<em style="z-index: 1;">did</em>&nbsp;teach justification by faith, perhaps even by double imputation.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Piper isn't alone here. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8tAPdR_Ndg" target="_blank" style="z-index: 1; outline: none; cursor: pointer; color: #231f20; text-decoration: underline;">video</a>) Long ago a German Lutheran, Joachim Jeremias, connected Jesus' term&nbsp;<em style="z-index: 1;">Abba</em>&nbsp;(Aramaic for "father") to Paul's theology of justification to show that this central message of the New Testament was found in both Jesus and Paul.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">But what weakens the attempt to make Paul fit into a kingdom vision weakens the attempt to make Jesus fit into Paul's justification paradigm. What makes Paul tick at the level of language just doesn't make Jesus tick. What makes Jesus tick in the kingdom doesn't make Paul tick. We either have to let Jesus be Jesus, who barely talks about justification, and let Paul be Paul, who barely talks about kingdom (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btEIiiUPrT8" target="_blank" style="z-index: 1; outline: none; cursor: pointer; color: #231f20; text-decoration: underline;">video</a>), or we have to find another way.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">I think there is another way, one that is fair to both and at the same time explains the inner unity at the level of&nbsp;<em style="z-index: 1;">gospel</em>.</p>
<h4 class="subhead" style="z-index: 1; line-height: normal; font-size: 1.15em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #dd3f1f; margin: 0px;">The&nbsp;<em style="z-index: 1;">Gospel</em>&nbsp;Way</h4>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">The problem with the two approaches—trying to make Paul fit Jesus' kingdom vision, or trying to make Jesus fit Paul's justification vision—comes down to this: each approach reduces the word gospel. For one group, it is equated with the kingdom. For the other, it is a synonym for justification by faith. To be sure, the word gospel encapsulates both kingdom and justification, but gospel operates on a foundation deeper than either. If we can grasp that, the supposed disjunction between Jesus and Paul disappears.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">So where do we begin to get a New Testament understanding of "the gospel"? With Paul! Not with Romans 3 or Romans 5, however, but with 1 Corinthians 15:1-8:</p>
<blockquote class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 12.666666984558105px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px 30px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #231f20; line-height: 13pt;">Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.</blockquote>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">As we can see, here Paul is about to define gospel, and in fact, this is the only text in the New Testament that does so. What he says next is crucial:</p>
<blockquote class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 12.666666984558105px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px 30px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #231f20; line-height: 13pt;">For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.</blockquote>

<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">A number of observations are in order.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">First, this is the gospel handed on to Paul (v. 3), which suggests it was the gospel the earliest apostles preached.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Second, the gospel saves people from their sins (v. 2-3).</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Third, the essence of the gospel is the story of Jesus (vv. 3-8) as the completion of Israel's story (v. 3). Both the word&nbsp;<em style="z-index: 1;">Christ</em>&nbsp;(Messiah) and the phrase "according to the Scriptures" are central to how the apostles understood the word gospel.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Fourth, there's not a word here about either kingdom or justification! Sure, you can probe "for our sins" until both themes bubble up to the surface, but we should at least let Paul be Paul when it comes to defining the&nbsp;<em style="z-index: 1;">gospel</em>. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qZHS7Buwak" target="_blank" style="z-index: 1; outline: none; cursor: pointer; color: #231f20; text-decoration: underline;">video</a>)</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Added together, it means this: The gospel is first and foremost about Jesus. Or, to put it theologically, it's about Christology. Behind or underneath both kingdom and justification is the gospel, and the gospel is the&nbsp;<em style="z-index: 1;">saving story of Jesus that completes Israel's story</em>. "To gospel" is to tell a story about Jesus as the Messiah, as the Lord, as the Son of God, as the Savior.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Thus, the question of whether the gospel of Jesus and the gospel of Paul are the same is radically reshaped. The question is not, "Does Paul preach the kingdom?" Nor is the question, "Does Jesus preach justification?"</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Or if, like Piper, we ask if Jesus preached Paul's gospel, then we are really asking, "Does Jesus preach Jesus?" Or, "What was Jesus' teaching about Jesus?" Or, "Does he preach himself as the completion of Israel's story?" Or, "Does Jesus preach his own life, death, burial, and resurrection?"</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">The entire New Testament comes together by answering all these questions. And the answer is&nbsp;<em style="z-index: 1;">Yes, Jesus preached himself as the completion of Israel's story.</em>&nbsp;Jesus preached the gospel (of Paul, of Peter, of John) because Jesus preached himself. Any reading of the Gospels, and any Gospel will do, leads constantly to this question that Jesus himself asked those who saw him and heard him: "Who am I?"</p>
<h4 class="subhead" style="z-index: 1; line-height: normal; font-size: 1.15em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #dd3f1f; margin: 0px;">What Jesus Thought of Jesus</h4>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Let's start with Jesus' teaching about the kingdom. His inaugural sermon in his hometown synagogue, at Nazareth, is a profoundly and properly egocentric statement about himself. We miss the essence of this passage if we reduce the story to kingdom only. Jesus reads from Isaiah 61:1-2, a passage about end-time kingdom redemption. But what we need to note is that Jesus thinks he is the agent of that redemption, that he is none other than the "anointed" one.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Another key kingdom text is Luke 7:20-23. John the Baptist asks whether or not Jesus is the "one who was to come." Jesus answers by creating a clever and beautiful mosaic from Isaiah (29:18-19; 35:5-6; 61:1). The last line is arresting in its bold claim: "Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of&nbsp;<em style="z-index: 1;">me</em>" (emphasis mine). In other words, Jesus claims that he fulfills those Scriptures. "The story of Israel," Jesus is saying, "comes to its completion in me." Again, the message of Jesus is thoroughly egocentric.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">This last text leads us to a set of Gospel texts that I call the "Who am I? Who are you?" texts. In these passages, Jesus and John the Baptist are in dialogue with one another and with others about who they are. I fear we skip over these passages because we know them too well. But let me suggest we ask a question about these Jesus and John conversations: What kind of people run around asking others who they are? And when they ask such questions, do they assume that the answers are found in the persons and predictions of the Bible? Which of us says to another, "Who do you think I am? Do you think I'm the figure from Isaiah or the Messiah or Elijah or Moses or the Son of Man or the Davidic king?" None of us, and if we did, we'd be assigned to the fringes of society and perhaps institutionalized.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Jesus and John seemed to have carried on a conversation about who they were. And while John doesn't seem always to be certain of who he is, Jesus always is certain about both who John is&nbsp;<em style="z-index: 1;">and</em>who he is.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">(Who did others think Jesus was? Matthew 16:14. Who did others think John was? John 1:19-28. Who did John think John was? John 1:22-23. Who did John think Jesus was? Matthew 3:11-12; Luke 7:18-23. Who did Jesus think John was? Mark 9:9-13. Who did Jesus think Jesus was? Luke 7:22-23.)</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">There is something here that courses through the pages of the Gospels: Jesus and John see themselves as the ones who complete Israel's story, and their story is the saving story. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dQSQfqfqtE" target="_blank" style="z-index: 1; outline: none; cursor: pointer; color: #231f20; text-decoration: underline;">video</a>) This is exactly what Paul said the gospel was. Jesus may have spoken of kingdom, and Paul may have spoken of justification, but underneath both kingdom and justification is Christology: It is the story about Jesus, who is Messiah and Lord and who brings the kingdom and justifies sinners by faith.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">Excuse me for piling on here, but only when we grasp the gospel as the saving story about Jesus that completes Israel's story do we see the profound unity between Jesus and Paul. Both "gospeled" the same gospel because both told the story of Jesus. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHptoehV0vc" target="_blank" style="z-index: 1; outline: none; cursor: pointer; color: #231f20; text-decoration: underline;">video</a>)</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">For example, what kind of person says this: "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them" (Matt. 5:17)? Jesus overtly declares that the entire Law and Prophets point to him and are fulfilled in him, which is to "gospel" exactly as does Paul, who&nbsp;says it this way: "according to the Scriptures."</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">What kind of person chooses the symbolic number twelve, which connects to the formation of Israel as a twelve-tribe people and also to the hope for the revival of the ten lost tribes? But there's more: Jesus does not include himself because he perceives himself to be the Lord of the Twelve. Jesus, by appointing twelve, saw history coming to completion and saw himself as Lord of that completion. That is gospeling! And it's the gospel of all the apostles.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">What kind of person predicts more than once that he will not only die but also rise, as Jesus does in Mark 9:31?</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">What kind of person sums up his life as the Son of Man who came to give his life as a ransom for many, but does so in ways that combine Daniel 7's Son of Man vision with Isaiah 42-53's servant image? That is what we find when we combine Mark 10:45 with Mark 14:24.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">What kind of person sees himself as the Passover, as Jesus does at the Last Supper? Here Jesus synthesizes profound images, makes sense of his own life through those images, and declares that he himself is the redeeming, forgiving agent for Israel. Again, we are right where Paul was in 1 Corinthians 15, when he said Jesus died "for our sins." This is Paul's gospel in the words and actions of Jesus.</p>
<p class="text" style="z-index: 1; font-size: 0.95em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16pt; color: #231f20; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 10px 18px 0px;">My contention, then, is simple: If we begin with kingdom, we have to twist Paul into shape to fit a kingdom vision. If we begin with justification, we have to twist Jesus into shape to fit justification. But if we begin with gospel, and if we understand gospel as Paul does in 1 Corinthians 15:1-11, then we will find what unifies Jesus and Paul—that both witness to Jesus as the center of God's story. The gospel is the core of the Bible, and the gospel is the story of Jesus. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDdrZRa7y5g" target="_blank" style="z-index: 1; outline: none; cursor: pointer; color: #231f20; text-decoration: underline;">video</a>) Every time we talk about Jesus, we are gospeling. Telling others about Jesus leads to both the kingdom and justification—but only if we begin with Jesus.</p>
