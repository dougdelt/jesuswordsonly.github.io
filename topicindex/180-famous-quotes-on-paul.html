The man who writes to the Romans, ‘The Law is spiritual’ (7:14), and again, ‘The Law is holy and the commandment holy and just’ (7:12), <strong><em>places under a curse those who obey that which is holy</em></strong>!... In his Epistles … he praises virginity (I-Tim 4:1, I-Cor 7:25), and <strong><em>then turns round</em></strong> and writes, ‘In the latter times some shall depart from the faith,... forbidding to marry’ (I-Tim 4:1-3).... And in the Epistle to the Corinthians he says, ‘But concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord’ (I-Cor 7:25).

<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">When pure religion descends upon the earth and makes its way among men, two things will happen. It will dissolve the false belief of the populace that they already possess it, and it will receive the opposition of religious institutions with pretensions to represent it. It was Saint Paul who started Christianity on the road which turned it into Churchianity. But he derived his Christian knowledge at <em><strong>second hand</strong></em>. He knew less about the work which Jesus sought to do on this earth than about the work which he himself sought to do. He is the true founder of the Christian Church, its first great propagator, but<em><strong> he is not the truest interpreter of Jesus' message</strong></em>. It is the <em><strong>Church's personal self-interest</strong></em>, however unconsciously present, which has <em><strong>made the apostle Paul the most praised Christian teacher and the most frequently mentioned one in all the sermons and writing of the clergy</strong></em>. Never having met Jesus, he should not be blamed for never having fully understood Jesus' teaching. The grave consequences of this misunderstanding appeared later in the form of <em><strong>obstacles which interposed themselves between Jesus and his true work</strong></em>, and which succeeded in diverting and distorting it. They were organization, dogma, hierarchy, and literalness. Where Jesus tried to create <em><strong>Christian individuals</strong></em>, Saint Paul tried to create <em><strong>Christian groups</strong></em>. This opened the door to hypocrisy, externalism, materialism, ritualism, priestcraft, persecution, and deterioration. The realizable kingdom of heaven within man had to give way to an <em><strong>unrealizable kingdom of God on earth</strong></em>. The way back to true religion must therefore lie through making a fresh start ...

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"Paul taught that the whole function of Jesus centred on his death which released the faithful from the burden of their sins, their misery and the power of Satan. In fact<strong><em> not a single word Paul wrote in the Epistles gives the actual teaching of Jesus, nor does he mention even one of his parables</em></strong>; instead he spreads his own philosophy and his own ideas. &nbsp;***</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"The point comes home best when one considers Paul's explicit statement that the human individual can do nothing himself to secure salvation, "Cf. Rom. 3,24; 3,28; 9,11; 9,16; 1.Cor. 1,29; Gal. 2,16). For according to Paul salvation depends solely on the Grace of God." (Eph. 2, 8-9).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"Thus the Pauline doctrine makes salvation a one-sided matter for God; people on earth have their hands bound (cf. Rom. 3,24; 4,16; Eph. 2,5; 2,8-9; 2. Tim. 1,9; Tit. 3,5-7). What Paul says here is of course<em><strong> quite attractive, because it is comfortable</strong></em>. By joining the fold, salvation ensues "automatically".<strong><em> No effort on one's own part is then necessary to arrive at the goal of life</em></strong>, for every Christian is saved once and for all by the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross at Golgotha.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"It means that one has only to sign up with this 'institution', pay the membership fee', and (lo and behold!) everything is settled for securing a seat in paradise for all eternity. Naturally such a teaching attracted many supporters and spread rapidly. <em><strong>After all it is easier to believe in something that can be had safely and comfortably</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Simply by the simple act of conversion a person is then redeemed, saved, made a child of God, and becomes a completely new person. According to this teaching,<strong><em> every attempt on one's own part to work towards salvation plays down Jesus' role, is even a deadly sin</em></strong>. And conversely, every person, however exemplary and good his or her life may have been, is declared by his teaching to be lost if he or she does not gratefully acknowledge the sacrifice of the cross as constituting their entire personal salvation.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"Most Christians think the greatness and uniqueness of Christianity stands and falls with the truth of his teaching. On closer inspection, however, it is found to be <strong><em>a fabrication, far removed from the real ideas of Jesus</em></strong>. There is<em><strong> no hint of the so called Christian doctrine of salvation in the gospels, either in the sermon on the mount - the quintessence of Jesus' message - or in the Our Father, or the traditional parables of Jesus</strong></em>!</span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"Paul is in effect the first Christian heretic, and his teachings, which become the foundation of later Christianity, are a<strong><em> flagrant deviation from the 'Original'</em></strong> or 'pure' form extolled by the leadership. Whether James, the 'Lord's brother,' was literally Jesus' blood kin or not (and everything suggests he was), it is clear that he knew Jesus...personally. So did most of the other members of the community or 'early Church,' in Jerusalem, including of course, Peter. When they spoke, they did so with first hand authority. Paul had never had such personal acquaintance with the figure he'd begun to regard as his 'Saviour.' He had only his<strong><em> quasi-mystical experience in the desert and the sound of a disembodied voice</em></strong>. For him to arrogate authority to himself on this basis is, to say the least, <em><strong>presumptuous</strong></em>. It also leads him to<strong><em> distort Jesus' teachings beyond recognition, to formulate, in fact, his own highly individual and idiosyncratic theology</em></strong>, and then to legitimise it by spuriously ascribing it to Jesus."</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"As things transpired, however, the mainstream of the new movement gradually coalesced, during the next three centuries, around Paul and his teachings.

Eisenman was led to this conclusion by the scrolls themselves, then found the references in the New Testament to support it.... Does Paul, then, belong in the company of history's 'secret agents'? Of history's informers?.... But in any case... the movement entrusted to the 'early Church' and the Qumran community was effectively hijacked and converted into something that could no longer accommodate its progenitors."</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"While in Caesarea, he [Paul] hobnobs in congenial and intimate fashion with the Roman procurator... he is also intimate with the procurator's brother-in-law, Herod Agrippa II and with the king's sister -- later the mistress of Titus, the Roman commander who will destroy Jerusalem and eventually become emperor.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"These are not the only suspicious elements looming in the background of Paul 's biography. From the very beginning, his apparent wealth, his Roman citizenship and his easy familiarity with the presiding establishment have differentiated him from... other members of the 'early church'. Obviously, he has influential connections with the ruling elite. How else could so young a man have become the high priest's hatchet man? In his letter to the Romans (16:11), moreover, he speaks of a companion strikingly named 'Herodian' -- a name obviously associated with the ruling dynasty.... And Acts 13:1 refers to one of Paul's companions in Antioch as 'Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the Tetrarch'....</span><br /><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"Paul's heavily escorted departure from the city, his sojourn in luxury at Caesarea, his mysterious and utter disappearance... these things find a curious echo in our own era.

<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: large; line-height: normal; text-align: justify;">Paulinism with its many implications has become a real heresy.&nbsp; The natural result of this warped system will undoubtedly be to discount the Words of God,&nbsp; abolish the underlying true essence of the Message of the Kingdom for this age, and present seeking believers with another Gospel, which is called the "Gospel of Grace." No greater lie has ever been foisted upon the people of God than this terrible misrepresentation of the True Purpose and Plan of the Creator God for man - as embodied in the so-called "New Gospel of Grace," which is accredited to the apostle Paul according to his interpretation. </span></p>

<p style="line-height: 15.75pt; margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">When searching for the truths of Christianity, this means&nbsp;<b style="color: #494a44; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large; line-height: 15.75pt;"><i>going back to the words of Jesus himself</i></b>. This is a rather obvious principle, yet here the majority of evangelical Christians get sidetracked.&nbsp;<b style="color: #494a44; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large; line-height: 15.75pt;"><i>They begin with Paul, not Jesus</i></b>. Many evangelicals&nbsp;<b style="color: #494a44; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large; line-height: 15.75pt;"><i>virtually ignore Jesus' teachings</i></b>— claiming they apply to an earlier dispensation, or to the ‘kingdom age.’ Others&nbsp;<b style="color: #494a44; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large; line-height: 15.75pt;"><i>reshape Jesus’ words to fit Paul’s words</i></b>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 15.75pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">How strange. Jesus said “A disciple is not about his teacher.” (Matt. 10:24.) Yet we make<b><i>&nbsp;Paul, the disciple, greater than the teacher</i></b>. We subordinate Jesus to Paul. We understand Jesus’ words only in the context of Paul's writings. In sharp contrast, the early Christians understood Paul in the context of Jesus’ teachings. Their <b><i>gospel was above all the gospel of Jesus</i></b>.&nbsp;</span></p>

It began with Martin Luther who said that the Book of Romans is “the chief part of the New Testament.” We may not use his exact words, but in practice we follow in his footsteps. However, a common sense approach to Scripture requires us to&nbsp;<b><i>begin with the Author of Christianity, Jesus Christ— not with Paul</i></b>. In our illustration of discovering what Scripture teaches about salvation, it means that we begin with the four gospels.
