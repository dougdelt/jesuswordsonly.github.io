<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Renan on Paul</span></h1>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #800080;">Biography</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span data-mce-mark="1">Ernest Renan (1823-1892) studied at seminary to enter Catholic orders. Then he studied at St. Sulpice to learn philology, including Hebrew. As he studied Hebrew, he began to go deeper into the subject matter. In the end, as his studies progressed, he chose a life not dependent on the church so he could write freely. He became an instructor at Crouzet's school for boys. (See "</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Renan">Renan</a><span data-mce-mark="1">," </span><em>Wikipedia.</em>)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In 1863, Renan wrote the immensely popular<em> Vie de J&eacute;sus</em>, soon translated into <em>T</em><em>he Life of Jesus.</em> He wrote many other books on the history of Christianity, and is regarded as a "literary genius." &nbsp;By 1891, his works affirm "the necessity of piety independent of dogma." (<em>Id.</em>)&nbsp;Late in life, Renan received numerous honours, including being made an administrator of the Coll&egrave;ge de France and a grand officer of the Legion of Honour.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #800080;">Renan Is Utterly Pro-Paul in relation to James/Jude/Revelation</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Renan's work <em>St. Paul</em> depicts Paul in a sympathetic light. He nevertheless agrees that the early church attacked Paul in the Epistles of James and Jude as well as Revelation. But Renan describes these anti-Paul writings, veiled though they were, by the early church as the "cries of hatred" "insult," "calumny," and "envy." He calls James the Just and the apostles who were concerned about Paul's possible "apostasy" against Moses the reflection of "shallow minds." (Renan at <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=NN8TAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=intitle%3ASaint%20intitle%3APaul%20inauthor%3ARenan&amp;pg=PA301#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">301</a>.) James supposedly obliged Paul to "hypocrisy" to observe the Nazarite vow in Acts 21 to prove Paul was obeying Moses still, forcing Paul to give pledges to the "littleness of mind."&nbsp;<em>Id..&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hence, Renan is underscoring the opposition of the Apostles and James in a negative light, making Paul look good in all these episodes.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #800080;">Yet Jesus Must Be Elevated Above Paul</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Despite Renan's sympathy with Paul in his battle with the early church, Renan believes Jesus still must be regarded as the light for the church at this time. Finally, Jesus's message is beginning to surface above that of Paul. However, Paul is the hidden rock that causes many to splinter from the true faith into unprofitable divisions. Renan does not blame Paul. It is our error in losing emphasis on Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">It is most interesting how Renan can hold both positions at once. He is extremely pro-Paul but also Jesus centric. He vigorously attacks the anti-Paulinism of the apostles John and bishops James and Jude. &nbsp;He exemplifies that you can be pro-Jesus of the 12 and a lover and respector of Paul at the same time.</span></p>

This man has torn off that sort of tight and fearfully dangerous swaddling-clothes in which the child was wrapped from its birth. He has proclaimed that Christianity was not a simple reformed Judaism, but that </span><span data-mce-mark="1">it was a complete religion, existing by itself.</span><span data-mce-mark="1"> To say that this man deserves to occupy a very high rank in history, is to say a very evident thing; but he must not be called a founder. It is vain for </span><strong><em>Paul</em></strong><span data-mce-mark="1"> to talk ; </span><span data-mce-mark="1">He is </span><strong><em>inferior to the other apostles</em></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">. He has not seen Jesus; He has not heard his word. The divine logia and the parables are </span><em><strong>scarcely known to him</strong></em><span data-mce-mark="1">.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span data-mce-mark="1">Even as regards the question of outward role, </span>Paul was <strong><em>far from having the importance, during his life, that we attribute</em></strong></span></p>

His churches were either slightly substantial, or denied him. The churches of Macedonia and Galatia, which are his own work, possessed little importance in the second and third centuries. The churches of Corinth and Ephesus, which did not belong to him with so exclusive a title, pass over to his enemies, or are not deemed canonically enough established, when only owing their existence to him. After his disappearance from the scene of apostolic struggles we shall find him soon forgotten. His death was probably regarded by his enemies as the death of an agitator. </span><span data-mce-mark="1">The second century </span><strong><em>scarcely speaks of him</em></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">, and apparently endeav</span><span data-mce-mark="1">ors to systematically blot out his memory</span><span data-mce-mark="1">. His epistles are then </span><strong><em>slightly read</em></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">, and only regarded as authority by rather </span><em><strong>a slim group</strong></em><span data-mce-mark="1">.* His partisans themselves greatly weaken his pre</span><span data-mce-mark="1"></span><span data-mce-mark="1">tensions." He leaves no celebrated disciples. Titus, Timothy, and so many others, who, as it were, constituted his court, disappear without renown. The truth is, Paul was personally too energetic to form an original school. He always crushed his disciples. With him they only fill the characters of secretaries, servants, and couriers. Their respect for their master was such that they never dared to teach freely. When Paul was with his band, he alone existed ; all the others were annihilated, or only lived through him. </span><span data-mce-mark="1">In the </span><strong><em>third, fourth, and fifth centuries</em></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">, Paul </span><strong><em>will increase wonderfully</em></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">. He will become the teacher par excellence, &mdash; the founder of Chris</span><span data-mce-mark="1"></span><span data-mce-mark="1">tian theology. The true president of those " great Greek Councils, which make Jesus the keystone of a system of metaphysics, is the apostle Paul. But in the middle ages, especially </span><span data-mce-mark="1">in the Occi</span><span data-mce-mark="1"></span><span data-mce-mark="1">dent, his fortune will undergo a strange eclipse.

He was not a </span><span data-mce-mark="1">saint. The dominant feature of</span><strong><em> his character is not goodness</em></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">. He was haughty, pertinacious, aggressive ; he defended himself, maintained his point (as is said in our days); his expressions were harsh; he deemed himself absolutely in the right; he clung to his opinions; he quar<span data-mce-mark="1"></span><span data-mce-mark="1">relled with different persons. He was not learned. It may even be said that he greatly injured science by his paradoxical contempt for reason, by his eulogy upon apparent folly, by his apotheosis of transcendental absurdity. </span><span data-mce-mark="1">Nor was he a poet either. His writings, works of the greatest originality, are without charm. Their form is harsh, and almost always devoid of grace. What was he then? </span><span data-mce-mark="1">He was an eminent man of action; of powerful soul, progressive, enthusias</span><span data-mce-mark="1"></span><span data-mce-mark="1">tic; a conqueror, a missionary, a propagator; the more ardent, from having at first displayed his fanaticism in an opposite direction</span><span data-mce-mark="1">. Now the man of action, noble as he is when he has a noble design in view, is less near God than he who has lived upon the pure love of the actual, the </span><span data-mce-mark="1">good, or the beautiful. </span><span data-mce-mark="1">By nature the apostle is a little narrow-minded. </span><span data-mce-mark="1">He wishes to succeed, &mdash; for this he makes sacrifices.

The man of action is always a poor artist, for his sole design is not to reflect the splendor of the universe. He could not become a man of learning, for he regulates his opinions according to political utility. He is not even a very virtuous man, for he is never irreproachable, &mdash; the foolishness and wickedness of men forcing him to covenant with them. Above all, he is never agreeable. Reserve, the most charming of virtues, is forbidden him. The world favors the bold, &mdash; those who help themselves</span><em><strong>.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span data-mce-mark="1">I persist, therefore, in thinking that the</span><strong><em> part taken by Paul in the creation of Christianity, should be ranked far below that of Jesus</em></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Renan elsewhere reviews the history of the early church's veiled attacks on Paul -- through the epistles of Jude, James and Revelation (Apocalypse). He starts off as follows in ch. 10:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #800080;">Historical Evidence of A Rupture At Antioch</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">[<strong><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NN8TAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=intitle%3ASaint%20intitle%3APaul%20inauthor%3ARenan&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">186</a></strong>] It is very apparent, nevertheless, that the rupture of Antioch left profound traces. The great church on the borders of the Orontes was divided, if I may be allowed to express myself so, into two parishes, &mdash; that of the circumcised on one hand, that of the uncircumcised on the other. The separation of these two halves of the church lasted for a long while. Antioch, as is stated at a later period, had <strong><em>two bishops</em></strong>, &mdash;<strong><em> one instituted by Peter, the other by Paul</em></strong>. Euodias and Ignatius are designated as having, after the apostles, become these dignitaries.</span></p>

It is even possible that one of these hateful letters has been preserved to us, in the epistle of Jude, &mdash; brother of James, and like him, brother of the Lord, &mdash; which constitutes a part of the canon. It is one of the most violent&nbsp;<em>facta </em>against&nbsp;<span class="gtxt_body">anonymous adversaries, who are represented as disobedient and ungodly persons. The style of the writing, which much more resembles the classic Greek than that of the greater portion of the New Testament, bears much analogy to that style of the epistle of James. James and Jude probably did not understand Greek. The church of Jerusalem perhaps had Hellenic secretaries for such communications.****</span></span></p>

Nevertheless, if Paul had been for ten years the sole chief of the churches of Asia, </span><span class="gtxt_body" data-mce-mark="1"><strong><em>we cannot understand how he should have been forgotten there so soon</em></strong></span><span class="gtxt_body" data-mce-mark="1">.

The churches of Asia in the second century, the church of Laodicea especially, are the scene of a controversy which attaches itself to the vital question of Christianity, and in which the traditional party shows itself not at all in harmony with the ideas of Paul.<span class="gstxt_sup" data-mce-mark="1"><sup>87</sup></span> Montanism is a sort of return to Judaism, in the bosom of Phrygian Christianity.

The <strong><em>second and third chapters of the Apocalypse</em></strong> are a cry of hatred against Paul and his friends. This church of Ephesus, which owes so much to Paul, is praised for " not being able to bear with them which are evil; for having tried them, which say they are apostles and are not&nbsp;<em> </em>for having found them liars; for hating the deeds of the Nicolaitanes,"&nbsp;<span class="gstxt_sup"><sup>71</sup></span> "which I also hate," adds the celestial voice."

" " But I have a few things against thee," says the divine voice to the church of Pergamos, " because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of</span><span class="gtxt_body"><strong><em> Balaam</em></strong></span><span class="gtxt_body">, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication."

And I gave her space to repent of her fornication, and she repented not. . . .
