<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Here are various defenders that Paul's Gospel of Grace supplants Jesus's Gospel of Salvation, and justifies ignoring Jesus's words or regarding words in Matthew attributed to Jesus as inauthentic.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Richard Jordan, President Grace School of the Bible</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">In this YouTube video with the title <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxpR4kgy3AQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">Christian Prayer, How to Pray to God</a>, Richard Jordan defends that nothing Jesus taught applies to us. Only what Paul taught, first recorded in Acts and continued in the Epistles, applies to us today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">I found this video on April 27, 2016 simply by accident. I was trying to learn how to pray better. I chose this video with no purpose to find yet another extraordinary and shocking example of Paulinism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Richard Jordan beginning at 4:57 minutes into the video says most Churches teach things that "have nothing to do with the dispensation of grace" that applies today -- most teach Jesus' words in his earthly ministry when Jordan says this an error, for those words of Jesus supposedly have no validity for today; only Paul's word are valid today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">Jordan says </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"when you go back to the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John -- the earthly ministry of Jesus Christ, ....where He is proclaiming what He calls the Gospel of the Kingdom....Jesus then dies, is crucified and resurrected, and then the Holy Spirit comes in the Book of Acts. [6:01] When you go back into these books back here [underscoring with chalk on a board the 4 gospels], and you try to go back there and get your prayer promises, and your prayer instructions, you're gonna have a problem ...because<strong><em> the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John where Christ is preaching the kingdom has nothing to do...those are instructions that have nothing to do with what God is doing today in the dispensation of the grace of God</em></strong>....If you relax a minute, and don't blow a gasket, just take a minute and relax, take a deep breath, ...I know what I am saying to some people is <em><strong>shocking</strong></em>. Is jarring. But I just challenge you. ...Look at Romans 15 verse 8, "Now I say Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision." So here is back in his ministry in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John and he [Paul] says He is a minister of the circumcision"...'to confirm the truth of God to confirm the promises to the fathers.' These are promises God made to the nation of Israel. And Jesus came in his earthly ministry to do what? He came to confirm those promises. ... You see the message that Jesus Christ is preaching about this coming over here [i.e., a later point in a time line] setting up a kingdom delivering the nation of Israel from the wrath of God in the tribulation period.... In Matthew 4:23 ...Jesus is preaching the gospel of the kingdom. <strong><em>What you have back here in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John is you have a Jewish Messiah preaching a Jewish message to the nation of Israel about the kingdom that is coming....He is Israel's Messiah. He has come as the minister of Israel. And he is preaching about Israel's coming kingdom</em></strong>....Jesus told his disciples that He was sent to the Lost Sheep of Israel....It doesn't mean God does not care about the Gentiles. It just meant the salvation of God would go through Israel down here to the Gentiles. The blessing of God is going to go to the Gentiles out here [i.e., the time when we are in the tribulation with the Anti-Christ]. In order for Gentiles to get it, Israel has to be converted. "All Israel will be saved," as it is written [by Paul]. That's what prophecy is about. That is what the kingdom program is about. [10:38] <strong><em>The books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are about that issue</em></strong>....</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The message you hear today, of most churches, most preaching you hear today is really the kingdom Gospel, the kingdom commission, the kingdom signs, the kingdom<strong><em> laws</em></strong>, the kingdom principles, and the kingdom promises. And when you go back here and try to take those Jewish kingdom promises, and <em><strong>put them on us today</strong></em>.. where <strong><em>Christ in heaven has been revealed through Apostle Paul -- a new ministry</em></strong> -- for the church, the body of Christ -- this was kept a secret [11:20] -- these people [i.e., pointing to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John] <em><strong>did not know about it back here</strong></em>. He doesn't reveal it until you come to the ministry of Paul. The body of Christ where there is no Jew or Gentile...but were one in Christ. When you get over here [i.e., Paul's ministry] and you go back there [i.e., Jesus' earthly ministry] and take that information [i.e,. Jesus' teachings] and put it over here, well that's when you must be rightly dividing the word of truth. If you don't make that distinction that God makes, you are <strong><em>going to end up with heartache and ruin</em></strong>. You're going to try to talk to God on a basis that He is not talking to you. ...You gotta get in your book, and <em><strong>rightly divide your book</strong></em>, so you can see what God is doing today. And the <strong>dispensation of Grace is found in the books of Romans to Philemon</strong>. That's where we are today in the dispensation of grace....If you <em><strong>claim promises back over here</strong></em> [i.e., Jesus' earthly ministry], they are going to <em><strong>just be a burden.</strong></em>&nbsp;[13:01]</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 24pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Pettingill &amp; Torrey, 1997</span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In <strong><em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZY1LAAAACAAJ">1001 Bible Questions Answered</a></em></strong>, two evangelical scholars -- Pettingill and Torrey -- write that Jesus's Gospel is not to be taught until the tribulation; for now we are only to teach what Paul taught -- a gospel of grace.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">We are convinced that this [<em>i.e.</em>, the belief that the church was commissioned to preach the Gospel of the Kingdom] is in <strong><em>error</em></strong>. It would be a strange thing to find the Church's commission in the Kingdom Gospel. (William Pettingill and R.A. Torrey,&nbsp;<strong><em>1001 Bible Questions Answered</em></strong> (Inspirational Press, 1997) at 120.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">They continue:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">I have long been convinced, and have taught that the<strong><em> Great Commission</em></strong> of Matthew 28:19-20 is <em><strong>primarily applicable to the kingdom</strong></em> rather than to the Church. If this were kept in mind we should not fall into confusion regarding our marching orders, which are found in Acts 1:8, with details in the Epistles to the Churches. <strong><em>The Matthew commission</em></strong> [<em>i.e.</em>, the command to preach Jesus's commands] will come into force for the Jewish Remnant<strong><em> after the Church is caught away</em></strong>. (<em>Id.</em>,&nbsp;<strong><em>1001 Bible Questions Answered</em></strong>, at 127</span>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">But it gets worse:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Mark's Gospel, like Matthew's and Luke's is primarily a kingdom book, and I am satisfied that <strong><em>none of them contains the Church's marching orders</em></strong> -- not even the so-called Great Commission of Matthew 28:18-20....To be sure, we are to preach the gospel to every creature but what Gospel? The only gospel known to the synoptics was the gospel of the kingdom. <strong><em>Our gospel of the kingdom [i.e., the one that he thinks matches Paul] is found among the four evangelists only in John</em></strong>.&nbsp;(<em>Id.</em>,&nbsp;<strong><em>1001 Bible Questions Answered</em></strong>, at 113.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">They mean John supposedly speaks of Paul's faith-alone gospel in a few verses, and those apply today, but all the faith-plus-works and follow-the-Law teachings of Jesus are supposedly effective only in the future during the tribulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Incidentally, their reading of John's gospel toward this end depends upon the modern mistranslation of<strong><em> pisteousin</em></strong> by Luther and our English translators. It was partly innocent because scholars had not found out yet in the 1500s that the Greek Septuagint of 257 BC rendered 'obeying' by the verb <em><strong>pisteuo</strong>. </em>Hence, the Septuagint Greek Bible was only dissected in the modern age, and it now allows us to unlock pisteousin (the present participle active form of <em>pisteuo</em>). This important change&nbsp;has been resisted due to centuries of dogma based upon its inadvertent mistranslation by Luther in 1522.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Ed Parish Sanders is a New Testament scholar renown as "the principal proponents of the New Perspective on Paul." ("<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._P._Sanders">E.P. Sanders</a>," <strong><em>Wikipedia</em></strong>.) His perspective places Paul as dealing with contemporary issues of Judaism, and whether its customs and laws made one superior versus Hellenistic customs and laws. Paul supposedly said the law did not have this effect, and Jews were not superior to Gentiles for obeying their Torah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In 1985, Sanders wrote that the Jesus of Matthew 23 who excoriates the Pharisees for not following the Law enough cannot possibly be the "historical" Jesus, <em>i.e.</em>, these are not truly Jesus' words. Why? Obviously because they conflict with Paul's views of the Pharisees as legalists (when Jesus says they are not, but too lax. See Matt. 23:23). Here are Sanders' words:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">As I argued in the preceding chapter, the Jesus of Matt. 23:5-7, 23-26 is <strong><em>not the historical Jesus</em></strong>. He is one who objects to the Pharisees because they are <strong><em>not righteous enough</em></strong>, and he favors <strong><em>a higher righteousness according to the law</em></strong>, while not denying any of the law, even its minutiae (see also Matt. 5:17-20, 43-8, 6:1-8, 16-18). Further, the charges of Matt. 23 are related to the use of tax collector to mean 'outsider,' which I take <strong><em>not to be an authentic saying of Jesus</em></strong>....We can be certain that Jesus did not use 'tax collector' as it is used in Matt. 5:46, and this counts <em><strong>against the authenticity of the passage</strong></em> on the hypocrites. [Matt.](6:1-4, 5-8, 16-18), and consequently<strong><em> against the authenticity of the charges against the Pharisees in Matt. 23</em></strong>.&nbsp;(E.P. Sanders, <strong><em>Jesus and Judaism</em></strong> (Foretress Press: 1985) at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ng9JaKKaeCIC&amp;lpg=PA277&amp;dq=jesus%20obey%20the%20pharisees&amp;pg=PA277#v=onepage&amp;q=jesus%20obey%20the%20pharisees&amp;f=false">277</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, Sanders simply eliminates any emphasis by Jesus upon righteousness from the Law because it does not fit Paul's view that the Pharisees were strict in obeying the Law. However, as we demonstrate elsewhere, the Dead Sea Scrolls and Josephus both record the Pharisees were lax on the Law, while esteeming their own traditions not found in the Law. Jesus was right they were lax; Paul was wrong that they were strict adherents to the Law. See our<a href="/topicindex/127-chapter-9-jwos-pharisees.html"> chapter nine</a> from JWOS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">What Sanders overlooks, but implicitly negates, is that Luke has Jesus give a virtually identical message to Matthew 5:17-19 on the Law never being abolished until all generations cease in Luke 16.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Carl Stange: Lutheran Who Paulinizes Jesus' Message</span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Carl Stange wrote an influential article in 1924 entitled "Zur Ethik der Bergpredigt," in <strong><em>Zeitschrieft fur Systematische Theologie </em></strong>at 58. The Paulinizing aspects of this are summarized in an article entitled "Carl Stange, Lutheran Paulinizing of Jesus's Message." It can be found in Clarence Bauman's book<em>, <strong>The Sermon on the Mount: Its Modern Quest for Meaning</strong></em> at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EFrsW_cJTFYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">177</a>. [Google books displays a different title, but this is a typo.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">One of the quotes Bauman cites from Stange is:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">"Fellowship with God is not achieved through ethical performance. From an ethical standpoint, it is a derogation of the idea of the good to seek its realization by <strong><em>imitating Jesus</em></strong>. The teaching about the ideal.... only serves to make plain the reprehensibility of the human condition... The meaning of the moral demand is not that it gives us the power for the good but rather that it shows us <em><strong>our impotence for the good</strong></em>." <em>Id.</em>, at 177, quoting Stange, <strong><em>Zur Ethik</em></strong>, at 59.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Stange is thus deliberately saying Jesus is not an example to imitate. Such effort would supposedly "derogate" the very notion of what it means to be good. And any of Jesus's commands to be good were not intended to incite obedience, but rather the realization of our weakness that we can ever truly obey God. This is solely derived from Paul being superimposed on Jesus's words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Professor Bauman aptly summarizes the message of Stange:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">"Stange&rsquo;s central axiom is derived <strong><em>not from Jesus but from Paul </em></strong>and reflects <strong><em>not the content of the Sermon on the Mount</em></strong> but the influence of Reformation dogma."</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">"Stange made claims about the Sermon on the Mount which its content does not validate. He <strong>read into it theories and experiences foreign to its sphere</strong>. Stange&rsquo;s misinterpretation of the Sermon on the Mount exemplifies the characteristically Lutheran hermeneutical incongruity of <strong><em>superimposing upon the teaching of Jesus the theology of Paul</em></strong>." (Baumann, <em>id., </em>at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EFrsW_cJTFYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA185#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">185</a>.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Dr. Dubose taught at the University of the South whose review was the <em><strong>Sewanee Review</strong>. </em>Dubose was in the Theology Department. Dubose in effect, in conjunction with this 'review,' taught Jesus did not truly speak with inspiration until the messages He gave Paul when resurrected because Jesus only then supposedly for the first time spoke with true inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">First, let's begin with the book review entitled &ldquo;Dr. Dubose's Gospel in the Gospels,&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong><em>Sewanee Review</em></strong> (University of the South: 1907) at 113. It explains Paul with &ldquo;extreme rarity&rdquo; mentions any words from Jesus. This makes Paul&rsquo;s doctrine comprise a &ldquo;fifth gospel&rdquo; which has virtually nothing in common with the four gospels.&nbsp;Instead, &ldquo;the Gospel, as [Paul] understands it, is&nbsp;<strong><em>not the teaching of Jesus while on earth, nor even His life on earth,</em></strong> but the work and the Person of the Risen Christ...The Risen Christ is St. Paul&rsquo;s Gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>Id.</em>, at<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=36g5AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Dr.%20Duboses%E2%80%99%20Gospel%20in%20the%20Gospels%2C%E2%80%9D%20Sewanee%20Review%20(University%20of%20the%20South%3A%201907)&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"> 113</a>. And thus, only the Risen Christ gives us the true gospel, and this Dubose claims, is "best stated by Apostle Paul."&nbsp;<em>Id. </em>See also William Porcher Dubose,&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_zQ1AQAAIAAJ&amp;ots=adiRr1uRuX&amp;dq=Duboses%20Gospel%20in%20the%20Gospels&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>The Gospel in the Gospels</em> </a></strong>(1906) at books.google.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">What does Dubose mean and the Sewannee Review which is the journal at the school DuBose teaches? They mean that Jesus' words on earth (rather than after Resurrection when Jesus supposedly communicates with Paul) are not as authoritative or inspired as when relayed through Paul when Jesus is now Resurrected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">First, Dubose asks whether Jesus taught on earth from wisdom or instead from divine inspiration.&nbsp;<em>Id. </em>at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_zQ1AQAAIAAJ&amp;ots=adiRr1uRuX&amp;dq=Duboses%20Gospel%20in%20the%20Gospels&amp;pg=PA75#v=snippet&amp;q=extreme&amp;f=false">75</a>. Then Dubose answers that it is obvious Jesus spoke with human wisdom, but then deflects our concern by saying it was no less true than inspired truth:</span></p>

I repeat, then, that the immediate capacity in which Jesus Christ taught was that of the truth which He taught. That was the truth,&nbsp;<em><strong>whether divine or human or both, but the whole actual&nbsp;truth of humanity</strong></em>, of human existence, human life, human destiny. He was Himself that truth &mdash; incarnate, personal, consummated.

Samdahl presumably wrote each article. Samdahl avowedly and unabashedly treats Paul as having the right to a sole emphasis over any lessons passed on by the 12 apostles, as we will quote momentarily. This website is thus useful to properly understand what Paul truly teaches without any forced gloss to try to make Paul sound more consistent with Jesus' teachings in the gospels. Hence, <em><strong>you can see Paul vs. Jesus' contradictions in an unvarnished way by reading this website</strong></em>. Yet the author is generally properly construing Paul's meaning, sharing with us along the way the true Greek. But the author's hermeneutic has the obvious flaw that he is <strong><em>ignoring that such contradiction</em></strong> of Jesus's teachings to the 12 is <strong><em>fatal to Paul's validity</em></strong>.

Then Paulinists teach this Plan B was supposedly accepted in great numbers, saving Christianity from its extinction. This, however, is mythology which Paulinists promote contrary to the history that proves the apostolic church, not Paul's church, was the successful center of Christianity even in Gentile lands. This remained true until under Emperor Constantine of Rome in the 300s gave Paul's doctrines ascendancy. This was because Constantine desired to abolish Sabbath and move observance of a weekly rest to the day to worship the Sun-God Sol Invictus on Sunday. This required Constantine's prelates to give emphasis to Paul who in 2 passages "abolished Sabbath," as scholars put it. This was the first time Christianity made Paul a major figure to follow -- almost 300 years after Christ!

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>My Comment</strong></span>: It unfortunately is Vince who will have to answer for why Vince rejected Jesus' words in favor of Paul's doctrine of grace. Vince teaches based upon Paul's doctrine of grace that disobedience to the Law (a) does not matter for salvation and (b) is preferred over any effort to obey because by trying to obey and be righteous - "heaven maimed or hell whole" as Jesus taught (Mark 9:42-47) -- supposedly results in "hell maimed" (repenters from sin who do so for salvation sake supposedly go to hell). Vince believes you obtain "heaven whole" --- unrepentant from sin solely because you believe in Jesus's resurrection per what Paul teaches in Romans 10:8 as the guarantee of heaven. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">What Vince is saying is so incongruous with Jesus that I believe if Vince truly just spelled out his thoughts, compared them to Jesus' words such as in Mark 9:42-47 or the words of Rev. 14:12, Vince would see things differently. He would realize it is himself, and not the messianic he is rebuffing, who will suffer hell if he stays on his current path without repentance from sin as measured in God's Law which Jesus says continues. See Matt. 5:17-19.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In an article 'What would Jesus Do?' at Grace Alive Ministries (non-profit from Pennsylvania), it proves Paul and Jesus had different messages on the Law in three areas. So then he admits they have different directions, and says as a result, the only commands to follow are the commands of the Ascended Christ funnelled through Paul. What is interesting is how he admits that the last thing Jesus did was clearly expand that His commands should go to the nations:</span></p>
<p class="Newsletter-Body-P" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">At the end of Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry<em><strong> the audience was expanded to the nations</strong></em> of the earth. However, the message still focused on &ldquo;the promises made unto the fathers,&rdquo; the establishment of the earthly kingdom. Those nations were also to observe the Law of Moses, &ldquo;all things whatsoever I [Christ] have commanded you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="Scripture-Text-P" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: <em>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you</em>: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. Matthew 28:19,20</span></p>
<p class="Scripture-Text-P"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"> But then when the author tries to separate the need of the 12 to teach even the NATIONS everything 'I commanded,' the author abandons this recognition, and ignores it. He claims Jesus' ministry is solely to Jews, and thus Paul's ministry is the only one to follow. To avoid any accusation that I am taking anything out of context, here is this outrageous claim to ignore the teachings of Jesus, and only listen to Paul (who in his epistles never directly quotes Jesus but the liturgy):</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In a March 2011 article entitled "<a href="http://jaredtotten.blogspot.com/2011/03/what-would-paul-do.html">What Would Paul Do?</a>" Jared says Jesus' did things we cannot because Jesus was God. The healings, walking on water, etc. 'So isn't it better to turn to Paul?' he effectively asks. I know this is not a serious scholar, but still&nbsp;Jared claims he is a Grace University graduate and Worship Pastor at Redeemer Church in Omaha. So here are his words:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I was thinking about WWJD bracelets today (don't ask me how I got there) and I suddenly realized that, in so many instances, that question is irrelevant, verging on incoherent. Almost like asking, "What would my iPad do?" Jesus, while human, was (and is) also God and that makes the position from which he did and said everything completely other.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">****</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">So I was thinking&mdash;as heretical as this sounds&mdash;that <strong><em>a better question</em></strong> to ask yourself as a Christian is simply "<strong><em>What would Paul do</em></strong>?"</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hold on, before you pick up stones to stone me. Paul himself wrote "<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Follow my example,<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span> as I follow the example of Christ" (1 Cor. 11:1)</span>. Throughout his teaching, Paul seemed to have an uncanny grasp of how the Gospel impacted our everyday life. It speaks into our marriages, our employment, our relationships. The list goes on and on.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">So perhaps "WWPD?" is too near-heretical to be beneficial for most Christians. But<strong><em> I would suggest that there are better alternatives to WWJD that actually have biblically grounded answers we can directly apply to our lives</em></strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">So WWPD is a "better alternative to WWJD...." There it is again ... abandoning Christ, preferring Paul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">On the Millard Community Church website is "<a href="http://www.millardcommunitychurch.com/Pages/wwjd.htm">What Would Jesus Do?</a>" which claims it is blasphemy to ask 'what would Jesus do?' to measure the moral decision-making we need to resolve. I kid you not! Even Paul said "put on the mind of Christ" and Peter says "be imitators of Christ...." So this has now gone to outrageous positions.</span></p>

<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, SansSerif, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: 24px; margin-left: 30px; background-color: #f0f8ff;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">James seemed to teach a combination of grace and works. (James Chapter 2) There is disagreement among Protestant churches as to just what James taught. I used to teach that he taught that we were saved by grace which would produce the works God gave us to do. In other words faith would bring forth the works given us from before the foundations of the world. I no longer believe that. I think he mixed law and grace together. Paul constantly mentions church leaders who <strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">were destroying his work by a mixture of Mosaic law and grace</span></strong>. Galatians is full of exhortations to stay away from this kind of teaching. <strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">James, I believe, is an example of this kind of teaching, which Paul says that those who teach this kind of heresy should castrate themselves</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, SansSerif, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: 24px; margin-left: 30px; background-color: #f0f8ff;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The Jerusalem church, which preached a "gospel of the circumcision" <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>never came into the pure message of Paul</strong></span>. It <strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">reverted back to the Mosaic Law</span></strong>. If God did not destroy the Temple, the Priesthood, and the genealogical records in the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in 70AD, <strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">the Jameses of the church would have destroyed Paul's gospel and we would not have known what he preached</span></strong>. God <strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">vindicated the "gospel of the uncircumcision"</span></strong> in the overthrow of those who still had confidence in the Temple and its rituals.</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, SansSerif, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: 24px; margin-left: 30px; background-color: #f0f8ff;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">**** <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">&nbsp;But <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Satan</span> picked up this discarded gospel which mixes law and grace and has injected it into most of the church. It was only supposed to be <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>a transitory gospel</strong></span> to aid the Jew born under the Mosaic Law to enter into the New Covenant of Grace. When that <strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">generation died, this gospel was to end</span></strong>.</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In truth, the Gospel of Paul misled his companion Trophimus to defile the temple by entering in an uncircumcised state. By God's Law, God had to destroy the Temple soon thereafter for such a violation. The Temple destruction proves the negative result of Paul's Gospel, not its vindication. See our article <a href="/topicindex/65-trophimus.html">Trophimus</a>. Also, please note that this indirectly is saying the 12 Apostles' Gospel -- the Gospel of Jesus -- was a "transitory gospel" -- a valid Gospel for a time, and this was Jesus' Gospel before Paul came along and delivered the supposedly true Gospel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">My friends, this shamelessly says that the Gospel of Jesus was a transitory gospel until Paul came along. Uggh!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">One of the most troubling thoughts is that Paul has so supplanted Jesus that when we study a Bible topic, most modern pastors quote Paul 90% of the time, and Jesus less than 5%. For 5 years, I kept charts of sermons as I listened, and found it averaged <em><strong>13 quotes of Paul to 1 of Jesus per sermon</strong></em>. This was shockingly true even when a parable of Jesus was being discussed. And we do this unconsciously because Paulinism is so saturated into the evangelical church. We do not perceive it because we are conditioned to think Paul's doctrines are just as valid as those from Jesus, and there is thus no harm to this subservience of Jesus to Paul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">For example, here is an evangelical article -- "<a href="http://www.marriagemissions.com/scriptures-on-marriage/">Scriptures on Marriage</a>" -- giving advice for married persons. There is no Pauline slant to the doctrine expressed. But still, there is an enormous weight given to Paul. It is <strong><em>as if Jesus never spoke about Love, kindness, forgiveness, seeking to make things right with one angry at you</em></strong>, <em><strong>the nature of marriage</strong></em>, etc. All NT principles on these topics are solely quoted from Paul with few exceptions where Jesus gets a word in edgewise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In the article, there are <strong><em>111</em></strong> citations of Scripture, 95% quotes.<em><strong> Paul is quoted 38 times</strong></em>, often with long explanations. Of the quotes, <em><strong>Jesus is only quoted 6 times</strong></em>. And barely an explanation of His words appear. See below. In equal distance almost is James and Apostle John's letters which are each quoted 3x. Solomon does well, as we might expect, and Proverbs is quoted 27 x.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Let's review how Jesus' words were used to help on this important topic of marriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">First, Jesus is cited but not quoted from Matthew talking about God's plan that man and woman would form one flesh. An important passage, but not quoted and briefly mentioned. The article "Scriptures on Marriage" simply cites Matt. 19:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Second, Jesus is cited in a long string cite, referencing Matt. 6:23. There is no indication of what Jesus says there. Must not be very important, it appears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Third, without a quote, we learn: "As you read&nbsp;<a href="http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=31&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A31-32" class="bibleref" title="NIV Matthew 5:31-32">Matthew 5:31-32</a> you can see that 'Jesus is trying to move us from easy divorce to a deeper commitment to marriage.'&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>(</em>quoting<em> Dr. Roger Barrier)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Sadly this verse is not discussed or quoted even though it is apparently about marriage!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Next Jesus is quoted 2x but it is the same verse -- John 17:23, as part of this author's prayer -- "my prayer for marriages."&nbsp;&ldquo;May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.&rdquo;<em> </em><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><em>(<a href="http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=31&amp;passage=John+17%3A23" class="bibleref" title="NIV John 17:23">John 17:23</a>)</em> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">We are not told Jesus' prayer is similar; we are simply given the author's prayer. Poor Jesus, didn't He have a similar prayer? I guess we can just push Him aside, judging from this article, and call it 'my prayer.' (My tongue is firmly planted in my cheek.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Then Jesus's words on marriage are finally brought forth:&nbsp;&ldquo;So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.&rdquo;<em>(<a href="http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=31&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A6" class="bibleref" title="NIV Matthew 19:6">Matthew 19:6</a>)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Next, we learn this from Jesus: "Jesus said,&nbsp;&ldquo;I came that they might have life and have it to the full&rdquo; <em><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">(<a href="http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=31&amp;passage=John+10%3A10" class="bibleref" title="NIV John 10:10">John 10:10</a>)</span>.</em> Amazing! Just a quote finally of just Jesus speaking. Hard to hear him normally in this article, but finally we hear the Lord speak on His own!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The article ends with many quotes, and among these are 3 quotes from Jesus:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">&bull;&nbsp;But wisdom is proved right by her actions <em><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">(<a href="http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=31&amp;passage=Matthew+11%3A19" class="bibleref" title="NIV Matthew 11:19">Matthew 11:19</a>)</span>.</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">&bull;&nbsp;But I tell you that men will have to give account on the Day of Judgment; for every careless word they have spoken. For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned <em><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">(<a href="http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=31&amp;passage=Matthew+12%3A37" class="bibleref" title="NIV Matthew 12:37">Matthew 12:37</a>)</span>.</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">&bull;&nbsp;My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this &mdash;that he lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command <em><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">(<a href="http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=31&amp;passage=John+15%3A12-14" class="bibleref" title="NIV John 15:12-14">John 15:12-14</a>)</span>.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">That tallies to just <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>six quotes of Jesus</strong></span> -- the ONE who came to shed His blood for us. But <strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul gets quoted in full 38 times</span></strong>. The ratio is thus 38:6 in favor of Paul, or <strong>better than 6 to 1 in favor of quoting Paul over Jesus. </strong>This is an objective example of what I am saying has happened to our commitment to Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, it pretty much appears Jesus has disappeared from view, and is of marginal importance. We call Him Lord but pretty much make Paul our Lord. Sad but true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xw7rVCbW4o&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">Jesus v. Paul: The Two Gospels Compared</a> (Feb 2010) on You Tube, you hear first-hand the normative teaching today that indeed Paul and Jesus differed on things like idol meat, the law, etc., but Jesus was not preaching to Christians -- only Paul was. However, we supposedly need only follow Paul. Why? Because Second Peter calls Paul "scripture," and everything Paul said is thus supposedly infallible. And thus the only way the two contradictory views between Jesus and Paul on doctrine can be reconciled is by casting off Jesus' words to a defunct dispensation, and thus supposedly we need listen to ONLY Paul, so says this video-author. Uggh!</span></p>

One free of that incessant spelling out what Christianity represents through Paul can see the truth. It writes:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In chapter six of&nbsp;<strong><em>The Shocking Truth</em></strong> by Rev. Inlow, he relates that some of the KJV editors say that the book of Acts is the most important book of Christianity:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">We will start with a very startling quote provided by the highly renowned Bible scholars who wrote the Holy Bible [authorized or King James version] school and library reference edition. &ldquo;The books of the New Testament were all written after the death of our Lord and before the close of the first century. Of these books, <em><strong>the most precious single book is that of Acts</strong></em>. Because, if we lost one of the Gospels, we should still have three left, and if we lost one of the epistles, we should still have quite a number left. But if we did not have the Acts, we should not have any story of the foundation of the Christian church. The Gospels close with the ascension of our Lord. Then in order of time, comes the first epistle to the Thessalonians. Here we find a man named Paul, calling himself an Apostle, and writing to a church in Thessalonica.&rdquo;</span></p>

(Breaker erroneously thinks Roman Catholicism was anti-Paul, and it reflected "Peter" point-of-view. Breaker says Peter's views were worthy of rejection because based upon Jesus who was solely for Jews, not Gentiles. The truth is Roman Catholicism embraced Paul's anti-Law doctrine, espcially his anti-Sabbath rule, so as to permit Constantine's decree to move the day of rest to Sunday.
