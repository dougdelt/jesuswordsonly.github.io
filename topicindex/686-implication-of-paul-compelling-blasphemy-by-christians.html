<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and<strong>&nbsp;compelled &nbsp;</strong><strong><em style="font-family: Trebuchet, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">them</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;to blaspheme</strong>; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted&nbsp;<em style="font-family: Trebuchet, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">them</em>&nbsp;even unto strange cities.

Paul as a Pharisee persecutor would likely force Christians to say Jesus did his miracles by Beezelbub. This statement by Pharisees to Jesus was equally explained by Jesus to be an insult / blasphemy of God. See Matt 12:28-31. Hence probably Paul meant he did what other Pharisees did...that is, attribute Jesus miracles to Beezelbub, and Paul thus likely forced believers to do likewise or be killed / maimed.</span></p>

Would the true Lord Jesus have chosen <span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">someone as a witness of his resurrection who is a notorious sinner?

Or are such prior sinful acts by Paul evidence Paul would not under the Mosaic Law qualify to be a witness at all? If so, and our Lord Jesus certainly knew this Law, why would the true Jesus select Paul as a witness when Paul was discredited by his prior life? Does this constitute more evidence that Paul met an imposter Jesus outside Damascus, as we contend is the prophecy of Jesus in Matthew 24:4-5, 23-27? See this<a href="/topicindex/593-proofs-that-paul-did-not-truly-meet-jesus-outside-damascus.html"> link</a>.</span></p>

And does Paul's admissions he was a blasphemer, and forced others to blaspheme or be killed, mean Paul committed a sin that could not be justified under the Law of Moses? If so, is this why Paul in many places abrogates the entire Mosaic Law, and claims that one could be forgiven by Jesus of even blasphemy, as Paul implies in Acts 13:39 when Paul says:</span></p>

If so, is this more proof that (a) Paul could not be in true communication with the true Jesus? and (b) that Paul felt compelled to follow the "Jesus" of his Damascus experience -- the one who abrogated the Law -- for otherwise, Paul as a blasphemer knew under the Law of Moses that Paul could not be justified and thus pardoned of this sin?&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus said in Matthew 12:31:&nbsp;&ldquo;Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit&nbsp;<em><strong>will not be forgiven men</strong></em>.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus was distinguishing mere insults that are not against the Holy Spirit (God) versus insults against the Holy Spirit (God). We know this because the Third Commandment is known as the Blasphemy Command, and is unpardonable. Thus, Jesus is using "Holy Spirit" as a substitute for Yahweh, God, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In this Third Commandment, God specifies that it is UNPARDONABLE by means of the expression that "the Lord [Yahweh] will not hold guiltless" any person guilty of such sin. This means no repentance and no effort at asking for Jesus' atonement will save this person. This is the consequence of </span><strong style="color: #001320; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;">the sin of blasphemy</strong><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">. Here is the Third Commandment:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">7&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Thou shalt not take the name of the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Lord</span><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;thy God in vain; for the&nbsp;</span><em><strong><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Lord</span></strong></em><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><em><strong>&nbsp;will not hold him guiltless</strong></em> that taketh his name in vain. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A7&amp;version=KJV">Exodus 20:7 KJV</a>.)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">When translated into Greek in Leviticus 24, it is translated by the Greek word <em>blasphemeo </em>(verb) or&nbsp;<em>blasphemia</em> (noun). Thus, we know this sin as <em>blasphemy</em>. It means "slander." See <a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/988.htm">Strong's 988</a>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Thus, if one admitted one was a blasphemer, it meant you admitted violating the Third Commandment. This was its short-hand label. &nbsp;There is no sin in the Bible for blaspheming / insulting another than God, although an insult in the face of another person would put you in danger of judgement (for provoking hatred--a sin in another person), Jesus taught. Hence, an insult of anyone other than God was not per se a sinful blasphemy unless it provoked hatred, in which case one became complicit in the hate it causes.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Dennis discusses the Third Commandment this way:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">So then what is the worst sin? The worst sin is [violating]...&nbsp;the Third Commandment of the Ten Commandments. This is the only one of the Ten Commandments that states that&nbsp;<strong>God will not forgive who violates the commandment</strong>. What does this commandment say?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">It is most commonly translated as, 'Do not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. For the Lord will not hold guiltless' --<strong><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;meaning 'will not forgive</span></strong>,' -- whoever takes his name in vain. (Prager,&nbsp;<em>The Ten Commandments</em>&nbsp;(2015) at pages 20-21.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Here, this Jewish scholar helps us understand that when one commits this sin of violating the Third Commandment against blaspheming God, God will never pardon / forgive that sin.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Don't Assume It Is Easy to Commit This Unpardonable Sin</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Many people try to water down Jesus' words so a blasphemy is easy to commit. They do so to then argue that God could not truly have a sin that is unpardonable, because this one is so easy to commit. Therefore, we should supposedly not take Jesus seriously on this. (I have received this as one reply counter-argument to this truth about Exodus 20:7.)&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">So they say blasphemy is </span></span><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">simply using God's name lightly like we might say 'Oh my gosh... [name of God].' Blasphemy is rather an insult on God's name (Yahweh). How does one SLANDER God's name? </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">By associating God (Yahweh) with vulgar evil things, such as declaring God is evil, authors evil, that the evil you do you have done in God's name; or you claim God lies, deceives, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The word "blasphemy" in Greek means SLANDER -- such as an&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><em>insult</em>, casting&nbsp;<em>evil</em>&nbsp;falsely on the name or reputation of someone, which in this command against blasphemy means upon God's name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">A blasphemy that violates Exodus 20:7 must insult the name of Yahweh. As generally understood, the violator must have attempted to defame Yahweh <strong>by name</strong> to others, or implied Yahweh is the object of the insult. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The Pharisees attributed Jesus' miracles to the devil Beezlebub, which Jesus said insulted the Holy Spirit because by implication they called the holy spirit Beezlebub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Incidentally, the blasphemy of the NAME in Exodus 20:7 is another time called "blasphemy of the Lord" or "reviling the Lord" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-30.htm">ESV</a>) and the action provoking this categorization is translated as </span><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"sins defiantly" in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+15">Numbers 15:30</a> (NIV) or as "brazenly violates" God's Law (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-30.htm">NLT</a>). This appears to be another way of describing the sin of Exodus 20:7 - this time emphasizing that one flagrantly disavowing obedience to God openly in front of others thereby reviles (blasphemes) God in the process.&nbsp;</span></p>

Jesus exhorts the Christian to make the right choice, and fear hell more than physical death. Jesus too thus implies that there is a <em><strong>sin a Christian can commit to avoid death by a persecutor which will cause the Christian to go to hell.</strong></em> This remark by our Savior perfectly fits what Paul is talking about: compelling Christians to blaspheme on threat of death / other harm. This has to be blasphemy of God, to match the Savior's lesson. We discuss this in the next subject.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hence, by Paul's admission, we can only conclude Paul committed the unpardonable sin prior to becoming a Christian. Therefore, from what Paul himself says (we exercise no judgment on this point), Paul could never be covered by Christ's atonement as this was the one sin that was unpardonable.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;">Was Paul Self-Aware He Violated A Command That Was Unpardonable Under the Law?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Also, there is strong evidence that Paul realized he committed what was an unpardonable sin under the Law.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">For we can see there is one sin, and one sin alone, that one could never be justified from under the Law-- the sin of blasphemy of God's name. Paul by admitting he had previously blasphemed, Paul knew ordinarily that he could not be saved. Paul thus knew that unless the Law given Moses is set aside, and new principles divorced from the Mosaic Law apply, Paul could not be saved. Thus a Jesus outside Damascus who preached abolition of the Law would have an instant magnetic attraction for Paul, for otherwise Paul must die on earth with no hope otherwise of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Now with ears to hear, let's ask what did Paul mean in these two quotes:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Acts 13:39</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">and by Him everyone who believes is justified from&nbsp;<em><strong>all</strong>&nbsp;</em>things from which you<em><strong>&nbsp;could not be justified by the law of Moses.</strong></em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Titus 2:14</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from&nbsp;<em><strong>every lawless deed</strong></em>&nbsp;and purify for Himself His own special people, zealous for good works.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Thus, Paul insists that faith will justify you from "all things" from which "you could not be justified by the law of Moses." This can only be referencing the blasphemy of God's name. This is the only sin from which one could not be justified by the law of Moses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul then emphasizes again that "every lawless deed" can be redeemed by Jesus. Paul made no exclusion of the unpardonable sin, and thereby Paul expanded the scope of atonement and mercy to include something -- blasphemy in Exodus 20:7 -- which one could not be redeemed from under the Law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The scope of both comments only have importance regarding the blasphemy committed in violation of Exodus 20:7. This was the only sin one would not be pardoned by God no matter what. You could never have justification for it. So Paul would have a special personal reason to specifically say that one of faith can be justified of those things that one could not be justified from under the Law -- which only is blasphemy under Exodus 20:7.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Paul is Still Potentially A Brother in Chri</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">st</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This is not the same as saying Paul was not a brother. Paul affirmed Jesus was Messiah and Son of God. Jesus said he would build his church on those who made that confession. See Matt 16:16. If Paul could not be pardoned a sin of blasphemy, as he concedes having done, does not mean Paul was not a true brother. He would simply be a brother who due to the unpardonable sin cannot inherit the kingdom, or otherwise, God's word would be broken.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Paul's Responsibilty for Coercing Blasphemy</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Further, as we saw above, in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Acts 26:11. Paul admitted his guilt of causing Christian people to blaspheme. This casts on Paul the same spiritual state he forced upon others by means of coercion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">We saw that Jesus warned about persecution that would give Christians a choice between physical death and damnation. Matt 10:28. What could one coerce you to do that would cause damnation? Jesus told us: the crime of blasphemy of the Holy Spirit (God) which Jesus said was the unpardonable sin. We saw above, this is Exodus 20:7 - the crime of blasphemy of Yahweh's name directly or by implication. Jews still today recognize Exodus 20:7 as the unpardonable sin because 20:7 says of that sin God will never hold one "guiltless." This persecution about which Jesus spoke fits precisely what Paul was doing: persecuting Christians to blaspheme, in which they would suffer damnation if they were cowardly about physical death, as Jesus said in Matt 10:28.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, clearly Paul made Christians blaspheme unto eternal unpardonable damnation, as his actions fit what Jesus in Matthew 10:28 warned Christians would be their choice one day that they would face: unpardonable damnation in hell or physical death. This is likely what explains Paul's remark that "I was a blasphemer" in 1 Tim. 1:13.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">That's because Paul likely realized that by causing their unpardonable state, Paul thereby <em><strong>equally committed the same sin of blasphemy by forcing others to commit such unpardonable sin.</strong></em>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">For when one coerces another to do an act of blasphemy in violation of Exodus 20:7, the one forcing such action is at least equally a PRINCIPAL -- a violator of the Law against blasphemy in Exodus 20:7 that another was coerced to commit. You don't need a Torah provision to know this. Yet, legal codes spell out such common sense, such as&nbsp;</span><em style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large; line-height: 1.3em;">Cal. Penal Code</em><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">&nbsp;31 (one "who, by threats, menaces, command, or&nbsp;<em><strong>coercion, compel&nbsp;another to commit any crime</strong></em>, are&nbsp;<em><strong>principals</strong></em>&nbsp;in any crime so&nbsp;committed.")</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, this additional fact about Paul forcing Christians to blaspheme is another proof from Paul's own words that Paul could never be saved unless Paul were correct that the Mosaic law was abrogated on this and all other points. This fact also likely explains 1 Tim 1:13, proving that Paul clearly intended us to know he meant he blasphemed God, although he contended the Mosaic law prohibition on justification on this sin in particular is set aside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">As a result, by putting 1 Tim. 1:13, Acts 26:11, Matt 10:27 and Exodus 20:7 together, it appears clear that Paul committed a blasphemy of God / the Holy Spirit ( likely by following other Pharisees who said Jesus' miracles were done by the demon Bezelbub) and thus NEVER could be forgiven this sin of blasphemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Jesus too alludes to this principle, implying a WORSE punishment will befall the one causing a believer in Jesus to sin in a damning way than it is for the believer who so falls. This is Jesus' millstone warning, as we will discuss next below. This makes sense too -- that the one who coerces under physical threat a Christian to do a damning wrong is more guilty than the one who sins under a strong coercion.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Now we can understand better Jesus' words about a millstone. Jesus is talking about a believer who is ensnared in sin by means of a third-person -- just like Paul admitted ensnaring believers by forcing them to blaspheme. Jesus gives this warning to such a bully pressuring a believing Christian:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">and whoever may cause to stumble one of those little ones who are <em><strong>believing in me</strong></em>, it is better for him that a weighty millstone <em><strong>may be hanged upon his neck, and he may be sunk in the depth of the sea.</strong></em> <a href="http://biblehub.com/kjv/matthew/18-6.htm">Matt 18:6 YLT</a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus will then explain that a "believer in me" allowing a body part to be destroyed on threat of persecution is the better outcome than "stumbling" and ending up in hell. Jesus puts this succinctly -- saying you can go to "heaven maimed" or "hell whole" (unmaimed). See also <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+9:42-47">Mark 9:42-47. </a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus is talking at least about sins that damn you, and which you must avoid even if it involves a willingness to suffer physical deprivation of body parts to avoid that damning act. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">One under physical-based persecution to blaspheme, as Paul did to Christians which Paul admits in Acts 26:11, no doubt would find these commands from Jesus strenghtening their ability to endure suffering / mutilation &nbsp;and even death, if necessary, to avoid blaspheming unto damnation. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Sadly, Paul pronounced he was successful many times, and "compelled" Christians to blaspheme (Acts 26:11), and hence some Christians did not take Jesus' warnings as seriously as they should have.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Thus, Jesus is clearly implying that the <em><strong>one who has caused a believer to stumble into a damning sin like blasphemy</strong> </em>is himself going to be damned. It implies therefore that the one ensnaring the Christian will be damned and not forgiven. His sin is obviously unpardonable, and his damnation is certain. It appears Jesus at minimum had the crime of blasphemy in mind, aware prophetically of the later practice of the religious authorities as reflected in Paul's admission in Acts 26:11. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">For there, Paul says he forced Christians to blaspheme or be killed / harmed. Only then they would be released, now damned by the God they once served but who they were too cowardly to obey unto death. Yet, their tormentor (Paul here) would not go free, Jesus taught, and would suffer a worse punishment in hell than the Christian who fell.</span></span></p>
<h1><span style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Conclusion</span></span></strong></span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hence, let's put together all the facts:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">1. blasphemy of God's name is the unpardonable sin that no atonement or forgiveness is ever possible -- God will "not let them go guiltless" (Exodus 20:7), which Jesus reaffirms in Matthew 10:28 - identifying the "blasphemy" of God (referred to as the 'Holy Spirit)' is the UNPARDONABLE SIN;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">2. Paul admitted he was a blasphemer before becoming a Christian; and</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">3. Paul admitted he caused Christians to blaspheme as part of persecution.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">4. Jesus warned Christians in Matt 10:28 that persecution was coming that would threaten physical death or an act that would send them to hell, obviously the very type of act Paul admits doing -- a blasphemy that Paul admitted forcing upon Christians. A blasphemy of the Holy Spirit forced upon a Christian is the only sin that fits what Jesus spoke about in Matthew 10:28, thus making it obvious that Paul coerced the unpardonable sin upon Christians before Paul's Damascus experience.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Thus, by Paul's own words (not our judgment on Paul), Paul apparently could not be saved EVER as reaffirmed by Jesus.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The only escape is if one could believe Paul did not mean he blasphemed God / the Holy Spirit, and that he likewise did not mean that he compelled Christians to blaspheme God / the Holy Spirit. For reasons above, that is unlikely.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Why is this important that Paul likely could never have been saved?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Does it mean Paul was not a Christian brother? No.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">As I said above, Paul was still a brother as far as we can humanely know. It is up to the angels to determine whether Paul was a brother at a later time. (See Parable of the Tares.) Jesus says one becomes a brother as far as we can know humanely by confessing Jesus is Messiah, Son of God, as Peter did in Matthew 16:16. Jesus said upon this ROCK (foundational confession) Jesus will build his church.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">A Contradiction of Jesus</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">But this still has initial importance to help examine whether Paul truly spoke the words of Jesus at all times. Since Jesus cannot contradict himself, if Paul contradicts Jesus in an epistle, then Paul cannot truly be speaking for Jesus at all times in Paul's epistles.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">We will find that Paul contradicted Jesus in the very same statement Paul admitted he was a blasphemer.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Here is the full statement by Paul:</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul by admitting he was a blasphemer would be understood by his audience to refer to the Third Commandment. Paul confessed he violated that command. Jesus says it is UNPARDONABLE. Paul in 1 Tim. 1:13 says otherwise, claiming "I was shown mercy." (Yahweh says too it is unpardonable in Exodus 20:7.)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">What importance then is there that Paul directly contradicts Christ on this important point?</span></span></p>

Jesus said "those who are without sin throw the first stone." (<a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7.</a>) This is a reference to the testifying witnesses who had a duty to throw the first stone. Deut 13:7 et seq.; Lev. 24:11; Nu 15:33. Sanhedrin practice was to first vette and qualify each witness to be "without sin" before allowing them to testify. See also "<a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/865-adultery">Adultery</a>," Jewish Encyclopedia (Jesus's words in John 8:7 take on significance in light of Mishna-period Rabbi Akiba saying "only when the man is <strong><em>free of guilt</em></strong>" can the test of an adulterer be applied.) Jesus was in essence asking whether those two witnesses were present, and if not -- if a single witness caught the woman in adultery, for example, or the husband as a witness was disqualified due his unsuitable moral life, then she cannot be punished.</span></span></span></p>

Josephus explained that a witness's credibility would be determined by their past life. (Josephus, Antiquities 4:219.)</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>QUESTION</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Do you think Paul possibly devised the doctrine in his epistles of faith alone with no works worthy of repentance, to give himself justification even for blasphemy? It appears so. Listen now with new ears to hear. Pay particular attention to Paul's statement that "all things" that you could NOT be justified under the Law, now you can be justified in Christ from them -- and the only thing you could not be justified under the law for EVER was blasphemy:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Acts 13:39</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">and by Him everyone who believes is justified from <em><strong>all</strong> </em>things from which you<em><strong> could not be justified by the law of Moses.</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Titus 2:14</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from <em><strong>every lawless deed</strong></em> and purify for Himself His own special people, zealous for good works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul needed the sin of blasphemy to be pardonable when under the Law it was not. Unless abrogated, Paul never could be saved. Paul's claim was a superceding doctrine came -- one that could "justify" you from <strong><em>ALL things</em></strong> from which you "<strong><em>could not be justified"</em></strong> - forgiven, which obviously points to the sin of blasphemy - the only unpardonable sin in the entire Law.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Billy Graham Website Says Jesus' Words Are Overcome by Our Hope His Words Are Untrue</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Don Wilton at <a href="http://billygraham.org/decision-magazine/may-2013/you-shall-not-take-the-lords-name-in-vain/">Billygraham.org </a>in a 2013 article&nbsp;simply affirms Jesus can still forgive what Jesus said was unpardonable:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">And, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">what if you do blaspheme?</span></strong> Here it is again&ndash;my hope, your hope, every person&rsquo;s hope&ndash;Jesus Christ loves you. Here are three things you can do. First, look in. Examine your own heart before the Lord Jesus. Next, look out. When you do look out you will see that God is exactly who He says He is&ndash;in word, name and deed. And finally, look up. Look into His face and live. He loves you. He died for you. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">He wants to forgive you.</span></strong> There is hope.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">How did he deduce this? By affirming elsewhere that the sin of blasphemy is no longer an unpardonable sin:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><span style="color: #222222; line-height: 22.4px;">Taking the Lord&rsquo;s name in vain is<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em> not the unpardonable sin</em> </strong></span>any more than any of the other Ten Commandments are. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">This sin can be forgiven</span></strong> because the Lord Jesus Christ came and gave His life. This is exactly what the cross is about. Moses was the law-carrier. If you want Moses to run your life, you will be limited by the law instead of by God&rsquo;s grace. Jesus Christ came<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> not to do away with the law</span></strong> but to fulfill it. This is why it is imperative for you to repent of all sin and trust in Jesus Christ by faith.</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Wilton actually says Jesus did not come to do away with the Law -- which should mean the Law continues. Jesus even continued in Matt 5:17-19, and said not one jot or title will be expire from the law until the heavens and earth passes away. However, Wilton apparently also believes Jesus' fulfilling the Law's requirements for atonement means the law, including the law of atonement, expired at the cross. This supposedly does away with the 10 Commandments, and if he is consistent, the Law of atonement also expired. This law only supposedly exists under the Law given Moses. (There is no atonement principle pre-Moses recorded by Moses.) Hence, if Wilton were correct, Jesus' atonement no longer has any validity for us living after the Law of atonement expired at the cross -- it worked only for those who were under the Law -- and Wilton says no one is any longer under the Law since the cross. See what odd incongruities these Pauline thinkers end up in.</span></span></p>
