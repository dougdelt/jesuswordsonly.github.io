<h1>The Spirit of Python Promoted Paul in Acts 16:16</h1>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">In Acts, Paul encounters a demon possessed woman known as Python. She was popular at Philippi as a soothsayer whom people paid for prophecies. Those aspiring to be kings and rulers would vie for her endorsement to gain acceptance from among the people. Large parts of Greece fell to Philip of Macedon because Philip bribed the Python priestess to prophesy he would conquer. (See <em>infra</em>.) The Pythoness thus was a 'rock-star' -- to use a modern equivalent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">When Paul is at Philippi, this Python female-soothsayer followed him around for many days in the city. Everywhere Paul went she proclaimed him a man of God who declared "to us a way of salvation." Her intent was obvious: this demon-possessed woman hoped many would recognize and accept Paul as God's prophet, and accept his plan of salvation. (She said nothing about the true Jesus.) Paul did nothing to stop her for many days. Luke records:</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><sup>16</sup>And it came to pass in our going on to prayer, a certain maid, having&nbsp;<strong><em>a spirit of Python</em></strong>, did meet us, who brought much employment to her masters by soothsaying [<strong>manteuomai</strong>, "practice divination as in a 'false divination or<strong><em> false prophet</em></strong>'" &nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8I9FIrpqv0YC&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;f=false">Strongs G3132</a>. Cf. mantis = seer]</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><sup>17</sup>she having followed Paul and us, was crying, saying, `<em><strong>These men are servants of the Most High God, who <span style="color: #ff0000;">declare to us a way of salvation</span>;'</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><sup>18</sup>and this she was doing for many days, but Paul having been grieved, and having turned, said to the spirit, `I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ,<strong><em> to come forth from her</em></strong>;' and it came forth the same hour.&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016:16-18&amp;version=YLT">Acts 16:16-19&nbsp;YLT</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Paul's casting out in the name of Jesus the Spirit of Python from the young girl after "many days" of delay doing so does not prove Paul knew the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">true</span> Jesus. For our Lord specifically said that many who call on His name and use His name to cast out demons will be told by Jesus that "<strong><em>I never knew you</em></strong>." We must keep this passage in mind as we study whether the Spirit of Python's behavior proves Paul's salvation doctrines -- faith-alone / no works necessary / anti-law aka anomianism -- did not come from the true Christ:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><span class="text Matt-7-21"><span class="woj"><sup>21 </sup> <sup></sup>âNot everyone who&nbsp;<sup></sup>says to me, âLord, Lord,â will&nbsp;<sup></sup>enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who&nbsp;<sup></sup>does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</span></span> <span id="en-ESV-23339" class="text Matt-7-22"><span class="woj"><sup>22 </sup> <sup></sup>On that day&nbsp;<sup></sup>many will say to me, âLord, Lord, did we not&nbsp;<sup></sup>prophesy in your name, and <strong><em>cast out demons&nbsp;<sup></sup>in your name</em></strong>, and do many mighty works in your name?â</span></span> <span id="en-ESV-23340" class="text Matt-7-23"><span class="woj"><sup>23 </sup> <sup></sup>And then will I declare to them, â<strong><em>I&nbsp;<sup></sup>never knew you;</em></strong> <sup></sup>depart from me,&nbsp;<sup></sup>you workers of [ANOMIA (Greek for "lawlessness" or "negation of the Law."] (â (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%207&amp;version=ESV">Matt 7:21-23 ESV</a>.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">An anomian message of salvation means one predicated upon the negation of the Law which God gave Moses. For discussion of "Anomia" in Matthew 7:21, see <a href="/component/content/article/1-jwo/106-chapter-five-jwo.html">ch. 5 of Jesus Words Only</a>.</span></p>
<h2>What Is The Spirit of Python?</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">A "spirit of Python" meant a specific type of demonic spirit. The NLT of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2016:16-19&amp;version=NLT">Acts 16:16</a> translates it simply as she is a "<strong>demon</strong>-possessed girl." In 1 Sam. 28:7, when it is translated "Lo, a woman possessing a familiar spirit in En-dor," it is rendered as a "spirit of Python (OBH in Heb.) of Endor." (Jacques de Daillon (comte du Lude),&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Daimonologia: or, A treatise of spirits: Wherein several places of scripture expounded</span> (<span dir="ltr">Printed for the author</span>,&nbsp;<span dir="ltr">1723)</span> at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yc8cAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;f=false">114</a>-115.) The Hebrew word "OBH" is oftened rendered as&nbsp;<strong><em>sorcerer</em></strong>" or "necromancer" and was "often translated Python in the Vulgate [Bible]." (M. Oldfield Howey,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Encircled Serpent a Study of Serpent Symbolism in All Countries And Ages</span> (1900) at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SY6DUnOOZSAC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;pg=PA142#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;f=false">142</a>.) However, OBH was short for the Hebrew word ABADDON which John in Revelation 9:11 revealingly tells us is APOLLYON in Greek. Scholars concur APOLLYON means APOLLOS, the Sun-god (son of Zeus, the head god) whose temple was at Delphi where the Python statue with multiple heads of serpents spoke through the priestess. See our article "<a href="/component/content/article/1-jwo/379-apollyon-bible-study.html">Apollyon</a>." So who is the Python in relation to APOLLOS?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><img src="http://bks8.books.google.com/books?id=yc8cAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl" style="float: right;" /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"> "Python in Greek mythology was<strong><em> the serpent who guarded the Delphic</em></strong><strong><em> oracle</em></strong>....Apollo's prophetic seer was called Pythia." (Rick Strelan,&nbsp;<em>Strange Acts; Studies in the Cultural World of the Acts of the Apostles </em>(<span dir="ltr">Walter de Gruyter</span>,&nbsp;<span dir="ltr">2004)</span> at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tHS6RK68rsMC&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;f=false">113</a>.) Apollo was known as "Apollo Pythius because his symbol was the<em><strong> Python</strong></em>." (Dr Elsie Clark,&nbsp;<em>Spiritual Warfare</em>: Vol. 2&nbsp;<em>Battling Against Carnality</em> (2010) at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8I9FIrpqv0YC&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;f=false">189</a>.) Apollo was the Sun-god among the Greeks. At the core of Apollo's temple was a pyramid known as the "tripod" to symbolize the Sun's rays. (Technically, the god Phobus was the god of light, and he morphed into "Apollo Pythia." See <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/a/apollo.html">link</a>.) On this tripod sat a coiled serpent statue with three heads known as the Python. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">(Technically, Apollo previously slayed the prophesying Python, but now through his female Pythia priestess at Delphi, also known as Python, the Python spirit spoke. See Leadbetter, "<a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/a/apollo.html">Apollo</a>," Pantheon.org.) Thus, we find the Python was identified now as Apollo Pythius at Delphi:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Clearly, the spirit of Python is the<em><strong> spirit of Satan</strong></em> / Apollos / Lucifer -- the "blinding light" (see "<a href="/component/content/article/1-jwo/223-who-is-the-blinding-angel-of-light.html">Who Is Blinding Angel of Light</a>")&nbsp;-- even worshipped as a large three-headed Serpent. The "pythoness" -- the young virgin who would speak the Serpent's prophecies -- had to sit on the tripod at the Temple of Python / Apollo at Delphos / Delphi. Eventually there were always three young virgins who would alternate at the task.

<h2>How Is This Verse Typically Mistranslated?</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: large;">Obviously aware of the problem we are about to expose, most translations other than Young's Literal&nbsp;<strong><em>never properly translate</em></strong> this as "spirit of Python." So the King James simply has it the "spirit of divination." (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2016:16-19&amp;version=KJV">Acts 16:16-19 KJV</a>.) The NIV is even wimpier, saying simply she had a "spirit." (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2016:16-19&amp;version=NIV">Acts 16:16 NIV</a>.) Virtually all the rest are in line</span>.</span></p>
<h2>The Obvious Problem Being Avoided</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Now if this woman is demon possessed and Paul were following the true Christ, then<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> her declaration to others to listen to Paul for salvation represents a house divided against itself</strong></span>. It makes no sense.&nbsp;But if Paul were following unwittingly a false Christ, then this makes perfect sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Please distinguish this demon-possessed woman from the demons who recognized Jesus was Christ for the demons&nbsp;<strong><em>did nothing to consistently promote to others that Jesus was Messiah, Son of God, etc</em></strong>. Nor were the demons who recognized Jesus looked upon with high favor, and thus their recognition did nothing to help Jesus' ministry. See </span>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+3&amp;version=ESV">Mark 3:11-12</a>.&nbsp;But look at the very different evidence that 'the rock-star' demon Pythia (the priestess) promoted Paul for "many days" as having the true plan of salvation. In ancient Greece-Macedon, there was no more influential prophetess than the Python-priestess. She was routinely paid for her prophecies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">But look how Paul for days took advantage of her endorsement while never questioning himself why would the prophetess-Pythia who was serving Satan be endorsing specifically Paul's plan of salvation. Paul never asked himself if it were possible he actually met an imposter Jesus on the road to Damascus. Thus, as Luke tells the story, Paul at Philippi did not think through this problem but was glad even demons endorsed his message: "It may be noted that the missionaries<strong><em> did not question the genuiness of her inspiration by the spirit of Python, and also that it spoke the truth</em></strong>...." (M. Oldfield Howey,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Encircled Serpent a Study of Serpent Symbolism in All Countries And Ages</span> (1900) at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SY6DUnOOZSAC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;pg=PA142#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;f=false">142</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">But they should have questioned it, as this demon-oracle in the service of Satan was well-regarded by the pagans of the area. Why would Satan through her&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>deliberately try to promote Paul's ministry?</strong></span> Luke's account does not give this a second-thought even though the account clearly requires the Berean in us to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Thus, let's now look at the key aspect of this verse one more time:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">"A young girl...having a Spirit of [the demon] <strong>Python</strong>...having followed Paul and us, was crying [to the public many days], saying, '<strong><em>T</em></strong><em><strong>hese men</strong>...<strong>declare to us a way of salvation.'</strong></em>"<em> </em>Acts 16:16-17</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Hence, one can see that if Paul were serving the true Christ, demon spirits like Python who were popular and influential would not for "many days" go around following Paul telling people to accept Paul's "plan of salvation."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">And notice, the demon spirit of Python did not say to follow Christ, but specifically to follow Paul's plan of salvation. In Acts 16:17, the demon Python-spirit says: " `<strong>These men are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us a way of salvation;'" </strong> So the message of Christ on salvation was not being promoted, but instead the demon was<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> promoting Paul's very different plan of salvation.</span></strong> On the difference between these two gospels, see our page "<a href="/component/content/article/1-jwo/175-pauls-contradictions-of-jesus.html">Paul's Contradictions of Jesus</a>."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><em><strong></strong></em>Hence, Acts 16:16-17 is further confirmation that Paul was unwittingly serving Satan. We already deduced this about Paul's vision of someone saying "I am Jesus" on a wilderness road when Jesus warned us not to trust when someone "comes in my name" in the wilderness (see Matt 24:5, 24-27) because the only way Jesus will be seen on earth after the Ascension was if every eye on earth sees Him. (See <a href="/component/content/article/1-jwo/292-jesus-prophecy-about-who-identified-himself-as-jesus-to-paul.html">link</a>.) But that is not what happened on the road to Damascus, is it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Then what about Paul casting out the demon in Jesus' name? Does this prove Paul knew the true Christ? Emphatically NO!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">In Matthew 7, Jesus said many who work "ANOMIA" (negation of the Law) will be able to say they did many miracles and cast out demons in His name, but Jesus will say He never knew "you" to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">It thus proves nothing. Jesus may indeed have cast the demon out as a mercy to this young girl. His name is powerful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">What is important to take away from the passage is Paul, the avowed worker of appearing ANOMOS (see <a href="/component/content/article/1-jwo/106-chapter-five-jwo.html">link</a>), did not know the true Christ because if Paul did, then why would a popular and influential demon promote for many days Paul's plan of salvation? That would be a kingdom divided against itself, and Jesus said, in essence, that such things would not be true. Hence, it logically follows Paul did not "know" Christ, contrary to Paul's assumption of whom he met on the wilderness road outside Damascus.</span></p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Why did Paul get annoyed with the Spirit of Python promoting him after "many days" instead of initially? For why would a man of God want a demon promoting him? Scholars concede this while trying to flip it the other way: "it is something of a puzzle why he resented the girl's cries [of support]." (Henry Ansgar Kelly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Satan: A Biography</span> (<span dir="ltr">Cambridge University Press:</span> <span dir="ltr">2006) </span>at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gPIpQg0lRbMC&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=spirit%20of%20python%20promoting%20paul&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=spirit%20of%20python%20promoting%20paul&amp;f=false">56</a>.) The best explanation is Paul let this go on many days without rebuking the demon because it was helping until Paul realized that people would start wondering why demons were promoting Paul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Contrast the situation with Jesus in Matthew. At every encounter with demon-possessed people, Jesus cast them out of the person. Jesus did not leave them in their state "many days" to serve any personal advantage if they would identify Him as Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">A unique situation is presented in Mark that did not appear in Matthew. This is the Gospel scholars have deduced was written by a Paulinist, eliminating all prophecies critical about Paul in Matthew. See "<a href="/component/content/article/16-hebrew-matthew/364-marcan-priority-claim-is-invalid.html">Marcan Priority Claim</a>."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">While at first blush, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+3&amp;version=ESV">Mark 3:11-12</a> appears similar to what happened with Paul in Acts 16, on reflection it still markedly differs. Jesus in Mark's account apparently leaves the demons in place (unlike Matthew where Jesus always cast them out.) What happens is per Mark&nbsp;Jesus during a healing activity of many people tells "unclean spirits" who cried out "You are the son of God" not "to make him known."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Unlike Paul, Jesus in Mark 3 did not want anyone to perceive these "unclean spirits" as declaring His identity, apparently so this would not harm His ministry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Why? These demons were not like the popular and well-regarded demon of Python. These demons had caused medical infliction among the crowd. They were perceived negatively by the community. So having them promote Jesus would have been immediately harmful to Jesus' ministry, and would be Satan's intent in Jesus' case had Jesus let them speak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><strong>Python</strong>. The Roman historian Lucian records that "the dragon under the tripod spoke" at the Temple of Python. In the temple were kept a host of snakes. It is assumed "dragon" here meant one of the snakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">What is curious is that Apollo was the Sun god and the symbol of his power was a three-headed snake. When one considers the Sun-god at Rome became known as Sol Invictus, it actually traces back to the popular Apollo-Python god of the Greeks. Here is what&nbsp;&nbsp;M. Oldfield Howey,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Encircled Serpent a Study of Serpent Symbolism in All Countries And Ages</span> (1900) at<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SY6DUnOOZSAC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;f=false"> 143</a> says:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">The tripod on which the pythoness sat was another relic of the religion which it had superseded, for it was formed of a serpent of bronze, coiled spirally upwards in the form of a cone, and terminated in three heads. As the cone or pyramid was a symbol of the sun's rays, this typified the worship of Apollo,&nbsp;<strong><em>the Sun-god with that of the Serpent, the python</em></strong>, the earth deity.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Glossalia / Excited Utterances / Prophetic Words of Knowledge</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">The method of words of prophecy by the Python have a chilling similarity to modern 'words of knowledge' and 'glossalia' that I have personally witnessed in certain churches. I can verify words of knowledge are often amazingly accurate depictions of people, with their past excellently described by pure strangers, mixed in with some future promises that often are safe bets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Now remember, the gift of tongues of the 12 apostles was different: it was the ability to speak in their own tongue, and the listeners would hear it in their own language. See Acts 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">So here is what is so chilling to consider to explain how our modern behavior may have entered the church from copying practices of the Pythonesses of ancient Greece.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacharsis">Anarcharsis</a> in a travel journal of the 6th Century before Christ identified that "toward the middle [of the temple] is an aperture from whence came the&nbsp;<strong>prophetic </strong>exalation." (Howey, <em>id.</em>.,&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SY6DUnOOZSAC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;f=false">144</a>.) The young virgin would drink some water which "it is said [has] the virtue of&nbsp;<strong>disclosing futurity</strong>."&nbsp;<em>Id. </em>Interestingly, the young prophetess would have her limbs suffer "involuntary motions," and she uttered "plaintiff cries and deep groans" (<em>id.</em>) She then uttered "dreadful howlings which were eagerly collected by the priests." Then the priests went to work. Anarcharsis continues: "They arranged them in proper order, and delivered them to us in writing."&nbsp;<em>Id. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><em>Leadbetter summarizes it even more pointedly, unaware how this might educate Christians to problems about Paul's glossalia instructions: "After she mumbled her answer, a male priest would translate it for the supplicant." (Ron Leadbetter,</em><em> "<a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/a/apollo.html">Apollo</a>," Pantheon.org (2012).)</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">What is interesting is how similar this is to Paul's version of the gift of tongues. The true apostolic gift of tongues was the ability of an apostle to speak and those of another language to hear their own language spoken. Luke notes this is its nature in Acts 1. However, Paul gives the same name to something totally different -- something identical to the ecstatic utterances of the "spirit of Python" where another would interpret and write it down. The words were not readily understandable as they were supposed to be had they been the true apostolic gift revealed in Acts 1. But Paul discloses his very different version from the original gift of tongues in the following quote, and please note how strikingly similar it is the "spirit of Python" and her interpreters:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">"If any man speak in<strong><em> an unknown tongue</em></strong>, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that in turn; and <em><strong>let one interpret.</strong></em>" (<a href="http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/14-27.htm">1 Cor. 14:27 KJV</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">One must thus wonder if Paul's stinger in the flesh from Satan impaled him somehow with Satan's spirit of Python -- what Paul unwittingly reveals when he describes the glossalia-spirit, of which Paul says in very modest terms (I am being facetious):</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><sup>18</sup> I thank God that I speak in tongues<em><strong> more than all of you</strong></em>. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor.%2014:18&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 14:18 NIV</a>.)</span></p>
<h1>&nbsp;Python: As Ventriloquist</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The Greek term "python" had a secondary meaning of divination and the "belly talking," as if a ventriloquist speaking in a strange voice.

<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">EKHIDNA (or Echidna) was a monstrous she-dragon (drakaina) with the head and breast of a woman. She probably represented or presided over the corruptions of the earth : rot, slime, fetid waters, illness and disease.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">She was often equated with Python (the rotting one), a dragon born of the fetid slime left behind by the great Deluge. Others call her the Tartarean lamprey, and assigned her to the dark, swampy pit of Tartaros beneath the earth. Hesiod, makes her a daughter of monstrous sea-gods, and presumably associates her with rotting sea-scum and fetid salt-marshes. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">In all cases, she was described as the consort of Typhoeus, a monstrous storm-daemon who challenged Zeus in heaven. Together they spawned a host of terrible monsters to plague the earth.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></div>
