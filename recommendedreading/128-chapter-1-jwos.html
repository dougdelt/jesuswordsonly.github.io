<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Chapter One: Atonement - Be Reconciled To The One You Offended Or No Effect</span></h1>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #3366ff;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Cheap Grace Claims You Receive An Irrevocable Covering Of All Future Sin Upon Faith Alone</strong></span></h3>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><a name="pgfId=477001"></a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The standard faith alone view is that once you believe in Jesus, His atoning blood washes you permanently. There is no other condition to acquire and/or retain atonement than simply a belief in Jesus as Lord and Savior. Typically, this belief is expressed in a sinner's prayer, either silently or out-loud. After being said, the sinner is told that if truly said from the heart, they are now saved forever, and cannot lose their salvation. Christ's blood was shed for them. They are permanently saved.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477043"></a>Hence, based on atonement, God not only erases your prior sin, but God also will never supposedly see any sin you commit in the future. An example of this common view is expressed by Don Fortner, the Pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Danville, Kentucky. He writes in God Sees No Sin<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/Salvation%20Redraft/Final%20Version%20for%20March%202008/Original%20Files/Atonementhtml.html#pgfId=477070" class="footnote"> 1</a>that once atonement is applied, then God never sees you sin again: "God sees no sin in His people...The Son of God... made an end of our sins, and justified and sanctified us by His blood." This cheap grace teacher directly applies this to our current state of ongoing (unrepentant) sin: "I rejoice to declare to every believing sinner that God will never punish you for your sins, hold you accountable at His bar for your sins,... because of your sins. For Him to do so, He must violate His own justice and overturn the satisfaction of His own Son."</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477094"></a>Charles Stanley, two-time president of the Southern Baptists and familiar radio-tv personality, makes it even more explicit. He insists that once you receive Christ's atonement based on faith alone, God never sees you sinning again. You are permanently covered. You need never worry again about sin costing you your salvation. Charles Stanley explains that no sin he can commit can "deprive me of my forgiveness God purchased in my behalf through Christ's blood at Calvary." (Stanley, <em>The Gift of Forgiveness</em> (Thomas Nelson, 1991) at 104.) Stanley writes that once God's forgiveness is given, no sin thereafter can change the atonement previously granted:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="Quote"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477118"></a>But a man or woman who has been rescued once from a state of unforgiveness need not worry. For once 100% of a man's or woman's sins have been forgiven, the potential for being unforgiven has been done away with. The risk factor is zero. There are no more fires from which the believer needs to be saved. (Stanley, <em>The Gift of Forgiveness</em> (Thomas Nelson, 1991) at 36.)(Emphasis added.)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477130"></a>Are Fortner and Stanley correct? No.</span></p>

Throughout the year, the people brought to the priests a variety of sacrifices. Each offering can be called a gift to God, but each gift was intended as an atoning sacrifice -- blotting out sin and cleansing the individual. In its article on "Atonement," The <em>Encyclopedia of Judaism</em> explains: "Every sacrifice may thus be considered a kofer, in the original sense <strong><em>a proprietary gift</em></strong>, and its purpose is to `make atonement' (`le kapper') for the people. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus+9%3A7%2C+10%3A17&amp;version=ASV">Lev. 9:7; 10:17</a>."<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/Salvation%20Redraft/Final%20Version%20for%20March%202008/Original%20Files/Atonementhtml.html#pgfId=479213" class="footnote"> 4</a> Atonement is intended to "cleanse the person from his guilt" (`<em>mehatao</em>,' Lev.iv.26, v.6-10)."

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=479217"></a>Thus, Jesus' reference is to a sacrifice at the Temple's altar. He was talking about atoning sacrifices which the priests received and then made on behalf of the people to grant them cleanness from their prior sin in God's eyes.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=479249"></a>Jesus in Matthew 5:23-24 was thus telling His audience that receipt of atonement had to be post-poned when there was still an unresolved sin problem between you and someone else.

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477289"></a>Jesus means you must leave your atoning sacrifice at the sacrifice-place if someone has something against you because you sinned against them. There is nothing defective in the sacrifice offered. It is perfect to atone for you. Yet, you are not able to receive its effect because of a defect in your past behavior. Jesus says you must first go home and be reconciled to those you offended. You must come to terms with your adversary while you are still in the way with him or otherwise, the debt you owe him will come back to haunt you later. You will end up in prison. (Matt. 5:25-26.) Instead, only after you appeased your adversary, can you come to the sacrifice-place and offer up the gift God has provided (Jesus) for you as the atoning sacrifice. (Matt. 5:24.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477292"></a>Hence, asking for atonement to apply to you must be postponed unless and until you have repented from your wrong and taken action that accomplishes reconciliation with the one you sinned against.</span></p>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><a name="pgfId=477363"></a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">God gave us an illustration from the life of King Saul of this principle. It demonstrates how abhorrent it is to God that people treat atonement as effectual for those who are sinning and unrepentant. God was incredibly angry with Saul for thinking bringing atonement to God had some magical power for even a disobedient person to receive forgiveness.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477380"></a>Who was King Saul? He was a Benjamite who assumed he could use God's sacrifice system without any condition of obedience. Saul was told to take no booty from an enemy of God. He was supposed to destroy their livestock and possessions. Saul did not do so. He had the intent of offering it to God in a sacrifice. God's response was not to accuse Saul of hypocrisy. God never suggests that Saul had no intent to make a sacrifice offering with the war booty. God's response takes Saul at his word in that respect. Rather, God rejects the Benjamite Saul's idea that a disobedient person's sacrifice has any value. Obedience must come before sacrifice. Obedience is the indispensable condition to bring an effectual sacrifice offering. This is the same lesson Jesus was teaching in Matthew 5:23-24.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477378"></a>This illustration is found in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+samuel+15%3A22-23&amp;version=ASV">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>. Saul disobeyed God but was planning on offering an atoning sacrifice using the booty he recovered. God said this was pure abuse of the principle of cleansing from atonement. The prophet Samuel on behalf of God rebukes the Benjamite Saul's logic.</span></p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477364"></a>22 Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, <em><strong>to obey is better than sacrifice</strong></em>, and to listen than the fat of rams. 23 For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has also rejected you from being king.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477365"></a>Hence, God places obedience ahead of sacrifice. The gift of an atoning sacrifice from the disobedient is rejected.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477366"></a>Thus, the Prophet Samuel taught when you disobey the Lord, you "have rejected the word of the Lord." The fact you intend to later ask for atonement from the Lord by some sacrifice you call upon (e.g., the gift of Jesus' sacrifice) does not wipe out the disobedience. It makes it worse.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477367"></a>It is equivalent to the sin of where man tries to control God: divination.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477368"></a>The Prophet Samuel says this is also presumption on your part. You are presuming on God's good nature that He will accept such sacrificial atonement even when you disobey God in expectation you can cleanse such acts by atonement.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477369"></a>Finally, Samuel says it is idolatry because your sin is worshipping your own power to set the terms of what God must accept. You become your own idol. You become your own demi-god, if you will, who can set the terms of when God must apply atonement to you.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Consequently, God does not accept atonement, even of an innocent lamb, on behalf of the disobedient.

This ten day period "was designated for seeking forgiveness between individuals."<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/Salvation%20Redraft/Final%20Version%20for%20March%202008/Original%20Files/Atonementhtml.html#pgfId=475917" class="footnote"> 12</a> Brad Young explains what this means:</span></p>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=475926"></a>Therefore, Jesus was clearly paraphrasing this temple principle on the atonement. Jesus laid down the identical condition:</span></p>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477495"></a>Jesus was obviously extending the principle from the Days of Ten to every sacrifice you bring to the priests throughout the year. There were many atoning sacrifices throughout the Biblical calendar year. Jesus did not restrict the principle of the Days of Ten simply to the Day of Atonement. Jesus made it an every-sacrifice principle.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=475927"></a>Therefore, once you recognize Jesus' effort to expand temple doctrine to an every-sacrifice principle, you see Jesus is talking about a condition to atonement.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Jesus' meaning is clear: before you can bring your sacrifice (<em>i.e</em>., any one of the many atoning sacrifices throughout the year), you must follow the Days of Ten principle. You must first seek reconciliation with the one you sinned against. It is implied that absent such action, the atonement would be ineffectual to cleanse you from sin.&nbsp;</span></p>

Jesus explains why: "You are already clean through the teaching I have already given you." (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+15%3A3&amp;version=YLT">John 15:3</a>.) Such teachings included "repent or perish" (Luke 13:5)<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/Salvation%20Redraft/Final%20Version%20for%20March%202008/Original%20Files/Atonementhtml.html#pgfId=477872" class="footnote"> 15</a> and the "heaven maimed" or "hell whole" principle, which clearly makes salvation 100% conditional on repentance and reform.

<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477552"></a>(7) but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and <em><strong>the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth</strong></em> [katharei, present active indicative] us from all sin. (8) If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. (9) <strong><em>If we confess our sins</em></strong>, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and <strong><em>[should have] cleans[ed] [katharei, aorist active subjunctive] us from all unrighteousness</em></strong>. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+1%3A7-9&amp;version=ASV">1 John 1:7-9, ASV</a>.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477553"></a>The exact same vocabulary used in John 15:1-6 is used here: the active form of <em><strong>katharei</strong></em>, to cleanse. Apostle John directly lifts out the verb cleaning from John 15:1-6. He then uses it in 1 John 1:7 in conjunction with the blood of Jesus his Son, saying it keeps us clean.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477689"></a>Apostle John thus says if we "confess our sins," then the blood of Jesus should have cleansed us. If we keep on obeying Jesus, then as "we walk in the light," <em>i.e.</em>, obey God, the blood of Jesus keeps us clean from all sins.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=478494"></a>What does <em><strong>walking in the light</strong></em> mean here? It is unquestionable that <strong><em>walks</em></strong> in 1 John 1:7-9 means <em><strong>obedience</strong></em>. This is how it was used a few verses later. In 1 John 2:3-6, John talks about "if we keep his commandments" versus "keepeth not his commandments." Apostle John stresses the importance to "keepeth his word." He then sums up his point, saying he who "abides in him ought himself also <strong><em>to walk even as he walked</em></strong>." (1 John 2:3-6, ASV.) <em><strong>Walking</strong></em> in the light in 1 John 1:9 must therefore mean <strong><em>obeying</em></strong> God's commandments.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, Apostle John takes the same vocabulary and structure of John 15:1-6 on <strong><em>cleans</em></strong>, and applies it to atonement. John unquestionably then says it initiates by repentance ("<em><strong>confessing</strong></em>") and is maintained by <strong><em>walking</em> <em>in the light</em></strong>. John then equates this <strong><em>walking</em></strong> <em><strong>in the light</strong></em> with "keeping his commandments."&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><a name="pgfId=477918"></a><strong>Apostle John's Doctrine On Obedience</strong></span></h3>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=478070"></a>To uncover Jesus' `walk in the light' requirement in John 15:1-6, it is likewise helpful to compare Apostle John's doctrine on obedience. After all, Apostle John is the one penning these words in John 15:1-6. Who better than John to give us insight on their meaning. The first proof, of course, is John's view that as we walk in the light, the blood of Jesus keeps us clean in God's sight. (1 John 1:7-9, ASV.) The second, and conclusive proof, is we find John saying the same thing in 1 John 2:3-6. As you read this, ask yourself whether Christ's blood can conceivably apply to a disobedient Christian:</span></p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477902"></a>(3) And hereby we know that <em><strong>we know him, if we keep his commandments</strong></em>. (4) He that saith, I [deeply] know [egnoka Gk.] him, and <em><strong>keepeth not his commandments, is a liar</strong></em>, and the truth is not in him; (5) but whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected. <em><strong>Hereby we know that we are in him</strong></em>: (6) he that saith <em><strong>he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked</strong></em>.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/Salvation%20Redraft/Final%20Version%20for%20March%202008/Original%20Files/Atonementhtml.html#pgfId=478578" class="footnote"> 23</a> (1 John 2:3-6)(ASV)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=477903"></a>As mentioned before, this passage involves Apostle John speaking again of walking. Thus, when he said as "we walk in the light" the "blood of Jesus" cleanses us (1 John 1:7), we see 1 John 2:3-6 identifies what walking means. It clearly means "keepeth his word" which is equated with "keepeth... his commandments." (1 John 2:3,5.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=478032"></a>What John also clearly says in 1 John 2:3-6 is that if you disobey Jesus, then you do not thoroughly know Him. The Greek word egnoka is formed by the prefix epi plus ginoska. The prefix epi here means above the norm, intensely. Thus, Vine's says its primary meaning is "to know thoroughly (epi, `intensive' [of] ginosko, `to know.')"<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/Salvation%20Redraft/Final%20Version%20for%20March%202008/Original%20Files/Atonementhtml.html#pgfId=478546" class="footnote"> 24</a></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=478533"></a>Thus, you do not thoroughly know Jesus if you do not obey Him. Your lack of obedience is not merely a reflection of your never having faith in Christ. Rather, it shows your faith is the same shallow belief that demons have. Your disobedience proves you do not thoroughly know Jesus. As a result, your disobedience demonstrates the "love of God has [not yet] been perfected in you." (1 John 2:3-6.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=478528"></a>Hence, be careful to note that if you are disobedient to Christ, John does not say it proves you never believed in Jesus. John knew those religious rulers who had "truly believed [epi-pisteousin] in Him but would not confess Him." (John 12:42; see&nbsp;<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/Salvation%20Redraft/Final%20Version%20for%20March%202008/Original%20Files/John%203%2016.#37659" class="XRef"></a>.) John wrote prior to his Gospel that such "cowards...will be thrown into the lake of burning sulfur" with "unbelievers." (Rev. 21:8.) Thus John knew disobedience is proof you do not know Jesus well enough. It is proof that the love of God has not yet been perfected in you.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In that light, 1 John 2:4 adequately explains what happens in 1 John 1:7-9 to the Christian who is not walking in the light. Such a Christian needs to repent and confess to have the blood of Christ cleanse them anew. You may have believed in Jesus but it ended there because you disobey Him. Disobedience makes your acceptance vain: "He that saith, I [deeply] know [egnoska] him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar." (1 Jn 2:4.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #3366ff; font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Isaiah Prophecy of Messiah Confirms Conditional Atonement</span></strong></span></h3>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><a name="pgfId=478094"></a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Remember we previously quoted Don Fortner, the Pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Danville, Kentucky? He had written in God Sees No Sin<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/Salvation%20Redraft/Final%20Version%20for%20March%202008/Original%20Files/Atonementhtml.html#pgfId=478135" class="footnote"> 25</a>that once atonement is applied, God never sees you sin again: "God sees no sin in His people...The Son of God... made an end of our sins, and justified and sanctified us by His blood."</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=478130"></a>However, in Isaiah, God warns that people will erroneously one day think when they sin that God does not see their sin. They will instead seek power over God with "incantations" -- the invocation of mere words -- in the hope these words protect them from God seeing their sin. Speaking of those deluded by such verbal "incantations," God says:</span></p>
<p class="Quote"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=479361"></a>You said, "no one sees me" -- but your wisdom and your knowledge have misled you.

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=478129"></a>In a word, people will wrongly think atonement applies so effectively that God never sees their ongoing sinning again as long as they utter an incantation. To disabuse people of this idea, God in Isaiah makes clear that the Servant who will suffer and atone for sin does not redeem those who recite incantations but only this type of person:</span></p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=478098"></a>And a Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob, <em><strong>who turn from transgression</strong></em>, says the Lord. (Isaiah 59:20, DSSB.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=478099"></a>God explains His principles of salvation that the Servant's sacrifice in chapter fifty-three provides:</span></p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=478100"></a>(7) Let the<em><strong> wicked forsake his way</strong></em>, and the unrighteous person his thoughts; let him <em><strong>return to the Lord</strong></em>, and <em><strong>He will have mercy upon him, and He will freely pardon</strong></em>. (Isaiah 55, DSSB.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=478101"></a>Deducing what this means is not difficult. If you "turn from transgression" and "forsake" your sinful ways and return to the Lord, God will freely pardon. Messiah will come to redeem those who do so.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=479371"></a>This redemption by Messiah was synonymous with atonement. In Hebrew, the word for atonement (kapper, kipper) derives from the noun kofer, which means ransom.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/Salvation%20Redraft/Final%20Version%20for%20March%202008/Original%20Files/Atonementhtml.html#pgfId=479385" class="footnote"> 27</a> The activity of ransoming is also called redeeming.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=479395"></a>Thus, the very prophecy of Messiah in Isaiah teaches the same principle of atonement, redemption and ransom as Jesus did. Atonement initiates for and belongs to the humble and contrite.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=479372"></a>This principle only becomes stronger the more you read all the Messianic passages in Isaiah. After promising the suffering servant would come to take sins away (atonement), God repeats His salvation principles in Isaiah 66:2 (DSSB): "This is the one whom I will look upon: the one who is humble and contrite in spirit and who trembles at my word...." God explains it is these alone who will "inherit my Holy Mountain." (Isaiah 59:13). The words humble and contrite (about sin) are synonyms for repentance from sin. The words <em><strong>trembles at my words</strong></em> are a synonym for obedience.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=478151"></a>Two verses later, God says of this inheritance: "For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: he will dwell in the height and the holy place, and also with <strong><em>the one who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the contrite, to revive the spirit of the humble</em></strong>...." (Isaiah 59:15 DSSB.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">This is the same message as Jesus gives in the instruction to leave the sacrifice at the altar and go be reconciled to anyone you offended. Only the repentant and contrite about sin will receive an effective atonement.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Ezekiel's Prophetic Message on Salvation</span></strong></span></h3>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><a name="pgfId=478613"></a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">A further confirmation of what Jesus is saying is by finding the parallel doctrine in Ezekiel. The Prophet has the identical logic to what Jesus says in Matthew 5:23-24.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=479409"></a>Ezekiel teaches when you are sinning, but repent (and do works worthy of repentance), you have (eternal) life, and all your sins are forgotten. (Note the order: repentance including works-of-reconciliation followed by wiping out of past sins.) However, when you are righteous but sin again, you (spiritually) die, and all your good deeds are forgotten. Life and death, in the spiritual sense, hence turns on obedience. Failure of obedience means death. Repentance and continuing to obey (maintenance) keeps you abiding in life. Despite Prophet Ezekiel delivering this message direct from God Almighty, few Christians have read this. Let's listen:</span></p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=478620"></a>And thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people, "The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, <strong><em>he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth.</em></strong> (13) When I say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his righteousness, and <strong><em>commit iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his iniquity that he hath committed, therein shall he die</em></strong>. (14) Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; <strong><em>if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; (15) if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. (16) None of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.</em></strong>" (Eze 33:12-16 ASV.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">What could be more plain? What could be more decisive on what Jesus teaches?

<h3><span style="color: #3366ff; font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Cheap Grace Commentators On Leaving Your Sacrifice At The Temple</span></strong></span></h3>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><a name="pgfId=477797"></a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The message of Jesus on atonement is not welcomed by faith alone doctrine. It would imply a condition other than faith is necessary to have atonement apply. Jesus would require first, just as the prophets had claimed, repentance from sin and works-worthy-of-repentance -- what Jesus describes as making reconciliation with the one you offended. You are to do what it takes to allay the righteous anger of anyone you offended.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">How do cheap grace commentators deal with Matthew 5:23-24? Do they elucidate its meaning by any plain reading? No. They do everything possible to downplay that this passage has anything to do with atonement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><a name="pgfId=479431"></a><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #3366ff;">Clarke: A Commentator In Turmoil</span></strong></span></h3>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=475959"></a>Clarke makes a commentary on this passage. He gets this right initially. Clarke says Jesus means "Do not attempt to bring any offering to God while thou...hast any difference with thy neighbor, which thou hast not used thy diligence to get adjusted."</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=475960"></a>However then Clarke tries to spin this to be about repentance prior to an "act of religious worship." He does not want you to see Jesus is talking about sacrifice -- Atonement.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=475963"></a>Clarke next tries to take the focus off the need for you to obtain forgiveness from sin against another. He says that the real problem is you have "enmity in your heart" and this needs to be removed. Clarke's claim is false.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=475964"></a>Rather, Jesus says the problem to overcome is that someone else has "something against you." It is not at all that you have some burning anger against the other.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=479441"></a>However, toward the end of his commentary, Clarke correctly restates Jesus' point. "<em><strong>My own obstinacy...must render me utterly unfit to receive any good from God's hands</strong></em>...." Yet, Clarke cannot bring himself to acknowledge this obstinacy impacts salvation. Clarke cannot say Jesus refuses atonement until one resolves their obstinacy about sin. So at the last second, Clark spins this again away from such a conclusion. He repeats the idea that my worship (not atonement) is unacceptable prior to repentance. What Jesus supposedly is talking about is not atonement but whether we bring to God "worship...in an acceptable manner."</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">One can see that faith-alone commentary is in turmoil as it tries to explain this passage. The reason is this passage utterly destroys faith alone doctrine. Tyndale was right.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #3366ff;">Conclusion</span></strong></span></h3>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><a name="pgfId=480120"></a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, while most today claim someone can come to Jesus in an ungodly state and be justified by faith alone, they do not understand the nature of atonement in the age of Christ. They think Abraham's faith is alone sufficient in the era of Christ. Yet, Abraham would have known that God put the atonement system in effect through Moses after Abraham. In fact, God says He deliberately delivered orders on "sacrifices or offerings" for the first time only after He first gave the Law (principally the Ten Commandments) to obey. (Jer. 7:22-23.) God says He did so to prove the priority of obedience over sacrifice. Id. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, when Jesus came to "fulfil the (Mosaic) Law" and not to "abolish it" (Matt. 5:17), Jesus did not come to fulfill any pre-Mosaic principle of atonement alive during Abraham's age. Jesus' atonement was only under the Mosaic Law. His atonement is hence subject to all the clarifications made by the Prophets on the conditional effectiveness for atonement under the Mosaic Law. </span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, in a post-Abrahamic age, even Abraham would know that <em><strong>no one who seeks that atoning sacrifice of Jesus to apply to them can accept the free gift of God on the altar and also imagine it has unconditional effectiveness</strong></em>. Abraham can read that the Mosaic principles are "eternal for all generations." (Ex. 27:21; 30:21; Lev. 6:18; 7:36; 10:9; 17:7; 23:14, 21, 41; 24:3; Num. 10:8; 15:15.) </span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, if you want the benefit of Jesus' atonement to apply to you, you have to accept it on Jesus' terms. His atonement only has a conditional effectiveness. You may not plea His blood until you "go thy way [and] first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy [atoning sacrifice]." (Matt. 5:24.) </span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">As Apostle John said, "confess your sins" and "keep walking in the light," and the "<em><strong>blood of Jesus will keep cleansing you</strong></em>." (1 John 1:7-9.)</span></p>

It literally means "sacrifice place." (Interlinear Scripture Analyzer.) Barnes concurs that this meant the "altar... in front of the Temple, and was the place on which sacrifices were made." Jesus uses this identical expression in Matthew 23:18, typically translated as "gift upon the altar." Barnes says in that verse Jesus means the "altar of burnt offerings" in the court of the priests. "It was made of brass, about thirty feet in length and breadth, and fifteen feet in height." He continues, saying here were "offered all the beasts and bloody oblations of the temple." See Albert Barnes,<em> Notes Explanatory and Practical on the Gospels: Designed for Sunday School Teachers</em> (Harper &amp; Brothers, 1853) at 262.</span></p>

("Atonement," Jewish Encyclopedia). There were various kofers to make for various sins. For example, if a man was killed by an ox, there was a special kofer for that. (Ex. 21:30, kofer.) The kofer was sometimes the blood of sacrifice. (Lev. 17:11.) Other times it was a money offering, called a kesef kippurim.

This also required dispensing with denominational names such as "Baptist," because it did not follow the original depiction of Christ's followers. Campbell said they were known as a "disciple of Christ." This effort to restore primitive Christianity led to the founding of the Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ. In 1880, there were 592 Disciples of Christ churches with 592,000 members. For more on the background of this movement, see http://www.mun.ca/rels/restmov/texts/wlhayden/etc/TCCODOC.HTM (last accessed 5/7/2007). In soteriology, they teach the necessity of "faith and repentance." They also emphasize obedience. See "Disciples of Christ," <em>A Religious Encyclopedia</em> (Ed. Philip Schaff)(1894).</span></p>

A parent who did not want to see their child killed due to wilful disobedience (under the Mosaic Law) in this life would deny ever knowing the child. The effect of such temporal relief was that the child was cut off from any inheritance from the parent. See my prior book, <em>Jesus' Words Only</em> (2007) at 208 fn.13.</span></p>
