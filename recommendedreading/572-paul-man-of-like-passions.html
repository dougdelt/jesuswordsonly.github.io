<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;Author assumes Paul has good words, and it is up to us to reinterpret Paul to align him with scripture and Jesus. The Author identifies numerous key issues of caution. The author implies in numerous places that Paul's words are ambiguous and easily twisted to ungodly ends, and are dangerous, and have spawned lies, while he excuses Paul from intending the meanings that the author concedes Paul's words do support. It is a kindly article, and approaches this from a sympathy to Paul, so it is clearly worth reading.</span></p>

The apostle's vanity often seemed to get the upper hand of his reason, even as he here stated: "so many others have been boasting about their worldly achievements, that I will boast myself" (verse 18). He then proceeded to boast about his pedigree and exult over his tribulations.

Clever interpretations of&nbsp; "dark&nbsp; speeches" feed the egos of the proud in heart as they probe into the philosophical labyrinth of human speculation. The letters of Saul from Tarsus provide an inexhaustible source for those who like to delve in to the Word of God merely for personal entertainment.

Unlike other Scripture,&nbsp; the works of this particular scribe must be handled with extreme care. His own words, in this same epistle,&nbsp; are proof that he did not mean that he was lawless,&nbsp; or without law. Did he not recognize the matter of law in regard to the man who had unlawful relations with his father's wife (l Cor. 5:1)?&nbsp; Did he not say that when he had been caught up to Paradise,&nbsp; he had heard words that were "not lawful for a man to utter" (2 Cor,12:4)?&nbsp; He also declared that we&nbsp;<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">"do not make void the Law through faith",</span>&nbsp; but instead we&nbsp;<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">"establish the Law”</span>&nbsp; (Rom. 3:31).&nbsp; And in chapter 7, verse 12, of the same book, he says that&nbsp;<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">"the Law is holy"</span>.</span></p>

Examine this apparent contradiction concerning those who died in the plague of Midian.&nbsp; In Numbers 25:9 we read:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">“And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand."</span>&nbsp;Now compare the above statement, made by Moses, with that of Paul’s in (1 Cor. 10:8),&nbsp;&nbsp;<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">“Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day&nbsp; twenty three thousand".</span>&nbsp; Did Paul miss the number by one thousand?&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul said that 23,000 fell in one day.&nbsp; The other thousand may have had a slow death. It is quite possible that it took a week or more for some of them to die. Moses was right; and Paul was right. Moses' account needs no explanation; but Paul's depiction of the event is misleading outside of the context of other Scripture.</span></p>

This disgraceful circumstance probably never would have occurred, had he not already made the most fatal error in his ministry: he had hot-headedly broken his union with Barnabas. The Holy Spirit had called Paul and Barnabas to work together as a team. The Scripture says,&nbsp;<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">"Barnabas . . , was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith"&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(Acts 11:22-24).&nbsp; Such a man could have been a big help to Paul: also, Barnabas was God's gift to him as a team mate of stability and deep character.&nbsp; Paul though, seems to have been a lopsided fanatic in almost everything that he did.

But,<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">"after a violent quarrel, they parted company ...”</span>&nbsp;(where was the 'charity' that&nbsp; 'thinketh no evil'?) (Acts 15:39).</span></p>

From that time on, he operated alone; he consulted with no man; be even refused to accept the counsel of the Spirit of God&nbsp; through other brethren.&nbsp; But let us not get ahead of our story - his third step toward disaster was occasioned by an overzealous self-determination to accomplish for God what the Spirit of God had said could not be done: He still believed that he could convert the Jerusalem Jews to Messianism.</span></p>

He seems to have been overzealous to the point of fanaticism in whatever cause or activity he espoused.

This was "a messenger of Satan",&nbsp; which was designed to serve as an instrument of restraint. The apostle himself did not recognize it as a gift, for he said:&nbsp;<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">"I besought God three times that it might depart from me"</span>&nbsp;(2 Cor. 12:8).

No one can deny that he was an example of extraordinary suffering for the sake of proclaiming the Kingdom of God. But also, there is no denying that the man had an overactive ego. He himself confirmed such a conclusion:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">"Lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelations, there was given me a thorn in the flesh "</span>&nbsp;(2 Cor, 12: 7).</span></p>

That is how we can tell the Spirit that speaks the truth from the one that tells lies.”</span>&nbsp;(1 John 4:6 CEV)</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Now where did John get that idea? YAHU’SHUAH in Matthew 10:14-15 said:&nbsp;<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">“And whosoever shall not receive you&nbsp;</span>(His appointed 12 Apostles)<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">, nor hear your words, as you go forth out of that house or that city, shake off the dust of your feet. &nbsp;Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.”</span>&nbsp;(ASV)</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span size="4" style="font-size: medium;">Those who reject the twelve apostles were condemned by YAHU’SHUAH Himself. The words of the twelve apostles, if rejected, cause us to be at risk of the fire suffered by Sodom and Gomorrah. This is not because their words are prophetic, but because of the Message the twelve personally carried from YAHU’SHUAH. If rejected, it puts us at risk of judgment by fire.</span></p>

Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group. The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray. When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the Gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, "You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew.

Paul boasts that he believes he is at their level:<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">&nbsp;“For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles”</span>&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 11:5. And in 2 Corinthians 12:11, Paul claims&nbsp;<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">“in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.”</span>&nbsp;There is some textual and historical reasons to think Paul calls the twelve false apostles in 2 Cor. 11:12-23, viz. verse 13 “<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">fashioning themselves into apostles of YAHU’SHUAH.”</span>&nbsp;(Is this not exactly what Paul claims and pursues himself, though he was never appointed as an apostle by YAHU’SHUAH – but only, at best, as a servant and a witness?

Apart from that, YAHU’SHUAH’s teachings are completely absent in Paul’s NT writings.</span></p>

Paul admits in Galatians that after he was called and converted on the road to Damascus, he then began his work for fourteen years before he ever went back to Jerusalem to learn from the apostles who were appointed by and who personally knew YAHU’SHUAH. (Gal. 2:1.)</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Times New Roman" size="4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Paul admits that until that time, he only had a brief two week visit to Jerusalem three years after his vision. Paul emphasizes his lack of contact with the twelve apostles by pointing out that in those two weeks he only met Peter and then briefly James, YAHU’SHUAH’s brother. Paul adamantly insists this is his sole prior encounter with the apostles within “fourteen years”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Times New Roman" size="4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Gal. 2:1&nbsp;<span color="#CC0000" style="color: #cc0000;">&nbsp;“But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb... to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. Then after three [more] years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. But other of the apostles I saw none, save James YAHU’SHUAH' brother. Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia”</span>. (Galatians 1:8-21)</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Times New Roman" size="4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">If the apostles were hand picked and trained by YAHU’SHUAH, &nbsp;He obviously did so in order that their witness would be full and superior to others. Then it should be incumbent on Paul to learn from them. &nbsp;Yet, by Paul’s own admission, he fails to do so for years. How then can Paul form the greater body of New Testament Scripture when his ideas are not based on YAHU’SHUAH's teachings? &nbsp;When his teachings so often oppose and overthrow the Torah and Tanach (OT) teachings? Christianity is being expounded by someone who never spent any extended time with YAHU’SHUAH, never trained under him, and whose writings are devoid of utterances of YAHU’SHUAH except a small unique aphorism and only one inaccurate quote from YAHU’SHUAH’s Last Supper (Pesach Seder) account.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Times New Roman" size="4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Other respected thinkers have been astonished by Paul’s lack of mentioning any lessons of YAHU’SHUAH. Albert Schweitzer once said: &nbsp;“Where possible, he (Paul) avoids quoting the teaching of YAHU’SHUAH, in fact even mentioning it. If we had to rely on Paul, we should not know that YAHU’SHUAH taught in parables, had delivered the Sermon on the Mount, and had taught His disciples the ‘Our Father.’ Even where they are specially relevant, Paul passes over the words of YAHU’SHUAH.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Times New Roman" size="4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">A modern Christian scholar, Hans van Campenhausen, agrees this deficiency in Paul’s writings is a striking and glaring problem:</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Times New Roman" size="4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">“The most striking feature is that the words of YAHU’SHUAH, which must have been collected and handed on in the primitive community and elsewhere from the earliest days, played no, or at least no vital, part in Paul’s basic instruction of his churches.”</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="color: #000000; font-family: ''; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Times New Roman" size="4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Paul in 1 Corinthians 11:24-25 quotes from the Last Supper at odds with Luke’s account. See Luke 22:19-20. Luke says Jesus’ body is ‘given’ but Paul says it is ‘broken.’ This variance is significant. As John 19:36 mentions, Psalm 34:20 says not a bone of His shall be broken. Paul’s quote is thus contradictory of Luke as well as theologically troublesome.</span></p>

The advent of the technology revolution has made knowledge available on a scale never imagined before.&nbsp; Out of this has grown a gradual movement amongst serious and sincere Christians, back to the True System of God.&nbsp; Seventh Day Sabbath churches popped up as early as the nineteenth century and restored the true ‘Sabbath of the Jews’. Further restoration included reinstatement of the Sacred Feasts of God (‘Jewish Feasts’).&nbsp; Then followed the Sacred Name Movement, restoring the original Hebrew versions of God’s Name.&nbsp; And of late, there arose&nbsp; “The Restoration of Hebrew Roots Movement” amongst dedicated Christian sectarians.&nbsp; This movement promotes the original Biblical (‘Jewish’) customs,&nbsp; and Hebrew language terms are used freely and intermittently. This movement, for many restoration believers, has lead to full conversion to Judaism - which completes the full circle back to the original Messianic Judaism of Messiah's time in Israel.</span></p>
