<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The Spirit of Python Promoted Paul in Acts 16:16</span></strong></span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">In Acts 14, wherever Paul went to evangelize with Barnabas, Paul was the &ldquo;chief speaker.&rdquo; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-12.htm">Acts 14:12</a>.) In Acts 16, Paul is preaching at Philippi, and is heard by a demon possessed woman known as <strong>Python</strong>. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16%3A16&amp;version=YLT">Acts 16:16</a>.) She was popular at Philippi as a soothsayer whom people paid for prophecies. Those aspiring to be kings and rulers would vie for her endorsement to gain acceptance from among the people. Large parts of Greece fell to Philip of Macedon because Philip bribed the Python priestess to prophesy he would conquer. (See <em>infra</em>.) The Pythoness thus was a 'rock-star' -- to use a modern equivalent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">When Paul is at Philippi, this Python priestess -- a female-soothsayer -- followed him around for many days in the city. Everywhere Paul went she proclaimed him a man of God who declared "<strong>to us a way of salvation</strong>." Her intent was obvious: this demon-possessed woman hoped many would recognize and accept Paul as God's prophet, and accept <strong>his plan of salvation</strong>. (She said nothing about the true Jesus.) Paul did nothing to stop her for many days. Luke records in Acts 16:16-18:</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><sup>16</sup>And it came to pass in our going on to prayer, a certain maid, having&nbsp;<strong>a spirit of<em> </em><span style="color: #ff6600;">Python</span></strong>, did meet us, who brought much employment to her masters by soothsaying [<strong>manteuomai</strong>, "practice divination as in a 'false divination or<strong><em> false prophet</em></strong>'" &nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8I9FIrpqv0YC&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;f=false">Strongs G3132</a>. Cf. mantis = seer]</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><sup>17</sup>she having followed Paul and us, was crying, saying, `<strong>These men are servants of the Most High God, who <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">declare to us a way of salvation</span>;'</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><sup>18</sup>and this she was doing for <strong>many</strong> <strong>days</strong>, but Paul having been grieved, and having turned, said to the spirit, `I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ,<strong><em> </em>to come forth from her</strong>;' and it came forth the same hour.&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016:16-18&amp;version=YLT">Acts 16:16-19&nbsp;YLT</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul's casting out in the name of Jesus the Spirit of Python from the young girl after "many days" of delay doing so does not prove Paul knew the <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">true</span> Jesus. For our Lord specifically said that many who call on His name and use His name to cast out demons will be told by Jesus that "<strong><em>I never knew you</em></strong>." We must keep this passage in mind as we study whether the Spirit of Python's behavior proves Paul's salvation doctrines -- faith-alone / no works necessary / anti-law aka anomianism -- did not come from the true Christ:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><sup>21 </sup> &ldquo;Not everyone who&nbsp;says to me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; will&nbsp;enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who&nbsp;does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</span></span> <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><sup>22 </sup> On that day&nbsp;many will say to me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord, did we not&nbsp;prophesy in your name, and <strong><em>cast out demons&nbsp;in your name</em></strong>, and do many mighty works in your name?&rsquo;</span></span> <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><sup>23 </sup> And then will I declare to them, &lsquo;<strong><em>I&nbsp;never knew you;</em></strong> depart from me,&nbsp;you workers of [<strong>ANOMIA</strong> (Greek for "lawlessness" or "negation of the Law."] (&rsquo; (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%207&amp;version=ESV">Matt 7:21-23 ESV</a>.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">An anomian message of salvation means one predicated upon the negation of the Law which God gave Moses. For discussion of "Anomia" in Matthew 7:21, see <a href="/recommendedreading/106-chapter-five-jwo.html">ch. 5 of Jesus Words Only</a>. See also our in depth study of the Greek word ANOMIA at this <a href="/recommendedreading/737-anomia-in-nt-means-negation-mosaic-law.html">link</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Jesus warns us in this quote that those coming with an anomian message who teach a salvation message that you need not obey the will of "my Father" and yet you will be saved anyway may cast out demons in Jesus' name, but this does not validate their false message. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">(Please note the Law applicable to Gentiles is primarily the Ten Commandments by restatements in the Law that extend them to a "sojourner&rdquo; within the community of the Israelites. The circumcision command is solely on &ldquo;sons of Israel&rdquo; in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus+12%3A1-3&amp;version=YLT">Lev 12:1-3</a>, and only extended to Gentiles who want to partake in Passover or enter the Temple standing at Jerusalem until 70 AD. See this <a href="/recommendedreading/98-law-applicable-today.html">link</a>.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">What Is The Spirit of Python?</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">A "spirit of Python" meant a specific type of demonic spirit. The NLT of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2016:16-19&amp;version=NLT">Acts 16:16</a> translates it simply as she is a "<strong>demon</strong>-possessed girl."&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">This Python priestess or Pythia oracle, as she was known, was a role rotated by three young women during the course of a day at Delphi and there was one at Philippi. (See below.) This had gone on for centuries. As we shall see, she spoke in gutteral grunts and screetches, and her words were translated by her scribe on a piece of paper to the person who wished her prophecy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">When she spoke, pagans thought she was supposed to have been given inspired messages from Apollo, the god of the Sun. Her prophecies were published far and wide, as the news of the day. People across Europe would be familiar with what her oracles said. This is reflected in the following instructive bit of information from an early church writer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">The famous church commentator, Origen, in 248 AD was debating with Celsus on what inspiration truly means. Celsus claimed there is not "only one God" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsus">link</a>), and instead there are many gods, and hence many inspired prophets. Celsus cited specifically "the oracles of the Pythian priestess" as unjustly being ignored as inspired by Origen. (Origen, <strong>Contra Celsum</strong>, link, at bk. 7, ch. 3, pg. 170.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Origen in reply conceded the Pythian Oracle was inspired (reflecting that Origen submitted to consensus in all Europe). However, Origen said her inspiration was not from God, but from demons, and hence were not true. Origen wrote -- apparently unfamiliar with what impact his words would have on a Christian reading Acts 16:6 -- as follows. Origen said to Celsus that two of her well-known famous prophecies of a divine and pious quality of two different individuals were demonstrably incredible, and hence obviously from a demon. So Origen writes in the 200 AD period to Celsus in <strong>Contra</strong> <strong>Celsum</strong> as follows:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">And in the responses of the <strong>Pythian</strong> <strong>oracle</strong> also you may find some injunctions which you may find are not in accordance with reason, two of which we shall adduce on the present occasion, viz. when it gave commandment that Cleomedes -- the boxer, I suppose --&nbsp; should be honoured with <strong>divine</strong> honors, seeing some great importance or other attaching to his pugilistic skill, but did not confer on either Pythagoras or Socrates the honors which it awarded on pugilism; and also when it called Archilocus "the servant of the Muses" -- a man who employed his poetic powers upon topics of the most <strong>wicked</strong> and <strong>licentious</strong> nature, and whose public character was dissolute and impure -- and <strong>entitled</strong> him "<strong>pious</strong>" in respect of his being a servant of the Muses, who are deemed to be <strong>goddesses</strong>. Now I am inclined that <strong>no</strong> <strong>one</strong> would assert he was a <strong>pious</strong> man.... [N]othing that is divine itself is shown to belong ... to the prophetic power of Apollo [i.e., Pythia, his oracle] ... [H]ow could anyone worship [him] as a pure divinit[y]? -- and especially when the prophetic spirit of Apollo ... secretly enters through the private parts of the person of her who is called priestess, as she is seated at the mouth of the Pythian cave! .... But let it be granted the responses by the <strong>Pythian</strong> ... were not false [prentention] of divine inspiration but on the other hand [they] may be <strong>traced</strong> to <strong>wicked demons</strong>.... (Contra Celsum, ch. XXV, <a href="http://www.documenta-catholica.eu/d_0185-0254-%20Origene%20-%20Contra%20Celsus%20-%20EN.pdf">link</a>, at page 63, 170.)&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, Origen says on two ocassions of which he presumed Celsus would know about, the Python priestess proved her inspiration was from demons as she gave divine honors to a boxer for being a boxer, and another time declared "pious" a dissolute poet for his service to his Muse goddesses.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">This background helps understand who is this Python Priestess, and how important she was across Europe. Origen lived in Alexandria, Egypt -- far from Greece where Celsus lived. Yet, Origen knew well these oracles, and could presume Celsus would acknowledge them as true in their written debate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">This quote from Origen thus readily reveals why Acts 16:6 is highly damaging to Paul. Yet, Acts 16:6 perfectly suited Luke's primary goal to address Theophilus to prepare Paul's defense in an upcoming trial before pagans, including Nero, the emperor. Why so? Because Nero would respect what the Python priestess had said about Paul.

Paul never asked himself if it were possible he actually met an imposter Jesus on the road to Damascus. Thus, as Luke tells the story, Paul at Philippi did not think through this problem but was glad even demons endorsed his message: "It may be noted that the missionaries<strong> did not question the genuiness of her inspiration by the spirit of Python, and also that it spoke the truth</strong>...."

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">But they should have questioned it, as this demon-oracle in the service of Satan was well-regarded by the pagans of the area. Why would Satan through her&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>deliberately try to promote Paul's ministry?</strong></span> Luke's account does not appear to give this a second-thought even though the account clearly requires the Berean in us to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, let's now look at the key aspect of this verse one more time:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">"A young girl...having a Spirit of [the demon] <strong>Python</strong>...having followed Paul and us, was crying [to the public many days], saying, '<strong><em>T</em></strong><em><strong>hese men</strong>...<strong>declare to us a way of salvation.'</strong></em>"<em> </em>Acts 16:16-17</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, one can see that if Paul were serving the true Christ, demon spirits like Python who were popular and influential would not for "many days" go around following Paul telling people to accept Paul's "plan of salvation."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">And notice, the demon spirit of Python did not say to follow Christ, but specifically to follow Paul's plan of salvation. In Acts 16:17, the demon Python-spirit says: " `<strong>These men are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us a way of salvation;'" </strong> So the message of Christ on salvation was not being promoted, but instead the demon was<strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"> promoting Paul's very different plan of salvation.</span></strong> On the difference between these two gospels, see our page "<a href="/recommendedreading/175-pauls-contradictions-of-jesus.html">Paul's Contradictions of Jesus</a>."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><em></em>Hence, Acts 16:16-17 is further confirmation that Paul was unwittingly serving Satan. We already deduced this about the appearance to Paul and others with him of someone saying "I am Jesus" on a wilderness road when Jesus warned us not to trust when someone "comes in my name" in the wilderness (see Matt 24:5, 24-27) because the only way Jesus will be seen on earth after the Ascension was if every eye on earth sees Him. (See <a href="/recommendedreading/292-jesus-prophecy-about-who-identified-himself-as-jesus-to-paul.html">link</a>.) But that is not what happened on the road to Damascus, is it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Then what about Paul casting out the demon in Jesus' name? Does this prove Paul knew the true Christ? Emphatically NO!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">In Matthew 7, Jesus said many who work "ANOMIA" (negation of the Law) will be able to say they did many miracles and cast out demons in His name, but Jesus will say He never knew "you" to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">It thus proves nothing. Jesus may indeed have cast the demon out as a mercy to this young girl. His name is powerful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">What is important to take away from the passage is Paul, the self-avowed worker of appearing ANOMOS (see <a href="/recommendedreading/106-chapter-five-jwo.html">link</a>), did not know the true Christ because if Paul did, then why would a popular and influential demon promote for many days Paul's plan of salvation? That would be a kingdom divided against itself, and Jesus said, in essence, that such things would not be true. Hence, it logically follows Paul did not "know" Christ, contrary to Paul's assumption of whom he met on the wilderness road outside Damascus.</span></p>

The account ends with Paul heading to Rome for a trial. The legality of Christianity stood in the balance. If it is just a sect of Judaism, and Paul is not a radical who committed a crime against Judaism, Christianity will survive as a legal sect. If Paul is founding a new religion outside of Judaism, and Paul committed an offense at the Temple against a legal sect, then Christianity may be outlawed. Christian scholars agree that how Luke addresses Theophilius indicates this was a trial brief to advise Theophilus for the upcoming trial of Paul.

However, Luke at the same time knew that among Pagans, to tell them the Python Priestess of Phillipi had "endorsed the way of salvation" taught by Paul, that is <em><strong>all they have to hear</strong></em>. If this proves confirmed, the case is over. Christianity survives to a pagan court because the Greco-Roman world's pagan religion will obey and listen to the Python as the light to emperors and peoples everywhere. </span></span></p>

It would no longer matter who Paul offended or did not offend. Accordingly, it is likely that <strong>Luke did see this issue</strong>, but the legal survival of Christianity was more important than shielding Paul from the embarassing aspect which Christians would readily recognize once pointed out. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Study Notes</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Why did Paul get annoyed with the Spirit of Python promoting him after "many days" instead of initially? For why would a man of God want a popular demon promoting him? Scholars concede this while trying to flip it the other way: "it is something of a puzzle why he resented the girl's cries [of support]." (Henry Ansgar Kelly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Satan: A Biography</span> </span>(<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Cambridge University Press:</span> <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">2006) </span>at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gPIpQg0lRbMC&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=spirit%20of%20python%20promoting%20paul&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=spirit%20of%20python%20promoting%20paul&amp;f=false">56</a>.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">The best explanation is Paul let this go on many days without rebuking the demon because it was helping until Paul realized that people would start wondering why demons were promoting Paul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Contrast the situation with Jesus in Matthew. At every encounter with demon-possessed people, Jesus cast them out of the person. Jesus did not leave them in their state "many days" to serve any personal advantage if they would identify Him as Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">A unique situation is presented in Mark that did not appear in Matthew. Mark is the Gospel scholars have deduced was written by a Paulinist, eliminating all prophecies critical about Paul in Matthew. See "<a href="/recommendedreading/364-marcan-priority-claim-is-invalid.html">Marcan Priority Claim</a>."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">In&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+3&amp;version=ESV">Mark 3:11</a>&nbsp;et seq. Jesus apparently leaves the demons in place (unlike Matthew where Jesus always cast them out.) What happens is, per Mark, that Jesus during a healing activity of many people tells "unclean spirits" who cried out "You are the son of God" not "to make him known."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Unlike Paul, Jesus in Mark 3 did not want anyone to perceive these "unclean spirits" as declaring His identity, so as to prevent the endorsement of demons. By contrast, Paul welcomed the support of demons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Python</strong>. The Roman historian Lucian records that "the dragon under the tripod spoke" at the Temple of Python. In the temple were kept a host of snakes. It is assumed "dragon" here meant one of the snakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">What is curious is that Apollo was the Sun god and that the symbol of his power was a three-headed snake. When one considers the Sun-god at Rome became known as Sol Invictus, it actually traces back to the popular Apollo-Python god of the Greeks. Here is what&nbsp;&nbsp;M.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">The tripod on which the pythoness sat was another relic of the religion which it had superseded, for it was formed of a serpent of bronze, coiled spirally upwards in the form of a cone, and terminated in three heads. As the cone or pyramid was a symbol of the sun's rays, this typified the worship of Apollo,&nbsp;<strong>the Sun-god with that of the Serpent, the python</strong>, the earth deity.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">The method of words of prophecy by the Python have a chilling similarity to modern 'words of knowledge' and 'glossalia' that I have personally witnessed in certain churches. I can verify words of knowledge are often amazingly accurate depictions of people, with their past excellently described by pure strangers, mixed in with some future promises that often are safe bets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Now remember, the gift of tongues of the 12 apostles was different: it was the ability to speak to foreign-language speakers, and the listeners would hear it in their own language. See Acts 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">So here is what is so chilling to consider to explain how our modern behavior may have entered the church from copying practices of the Pythonesses of ancient Greece.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacharsis">Anarcharsis</a> in a travel journal of the 6th Century before Christ identified that "toward the middle [of the temple] is an aperture from whence came the&nbsp;<strong>prophetic </strong>exalation." (Howey, <em>id.</em>.,&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SY6DUnOOZSAC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spirit%20of%20python&amp;f=false">144</a>.) The young virgin would drink some water which "it is said [has] the virtue of&nbsp;<strong>disclosing futurity</strong>."&nbsp;<em>Id. </em>Interestingly, the young prophetess would have her <strong>limbs</strong> suffer "<strong>involuntary</strong> <strong>motions</strong>," and she uttered "plaintiff <strong>cries</strong> and <strong>deep</strong> <strong>groans</strong>" (<em>id.</em>) She then uttered "<strong>dreadful</strong> <strong>howlings</strong> which were eagerly collected by the priests." Then the priests went to work. Anarcharsis continues: "They arranged them in proper order, and delivered them to us in writing."&nbsp;<em>Id.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">Leadbetter summarizes it even more pointedly, unaware how this might educate Christians to problems about Paul's glossalia instructions: "After she mumbled her answer, a male priest would <strong>translate</strong> it for the supplicant." (Ron Leadbetter, "<a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/a/apollo.html">Apollo</a>," Pantheon.org (2012).)</span><em></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Importantly, Origen in 248 AD in <strong>Contra Celsum</strong> used these fits of ecstasy to prove the Python Priestess was under the influence of demons, and not the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; He wrote: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">[I]t is not part of the divine spirit to drive the prophetess [Pythia] into such a state of <strong>ecstasy</strong> and <strong>madness</strong> that she <strong>loses</strong> <strong>control</strong> of herself. For he who is under the influence of a Divine Spirit ought to be the first to receive the beneficial effects, ... and moreover, that should be the time of clearest perception when one is in close intercourse with the Deity." ...For we are persuaded that the Spirit "mortifies the deeds of the body" ... If, then, the Pythian priestess is <strong>beside</strong> <strong>herself</strong> <strong>when</strong> <strong>she</strong> <strong>prophesies</strong>, what spirit must that be that fills her mind and <strong>clouds</strong> her judgment with <strong>darkness</strong>, unless it be of the same order with those demons which Christians cast out of persons possessed with them? (Contra Celsum, <a href="http://www.documenta-catholica.eu/d_0185-0254-%20Origene%20-%20Contra%20Celsus%20-%20EN.pdf">link</a>, pg. 171.)<br /><em></em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; background-color: transparent;">What is interesting is how similar the Python priestess received and relayed her messages to what Paul's describes as the gift of tongues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; background-color: transparent;">The true apostolic gift of tongues was the ability of an apostle to speak and those of another language to hear their own language spoken. Luke notes this is its nature in Acts 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; background-color: transparent;">However, Paul gives the same name to something totally different -- something identical to the </span><strong style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; background-color: transparent;">ecstatic</strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; background-color: transparent;"> utterances of the "spirit of Python" where another would interpret and write it down. The words were not readily understandable as they were supposed to be had they been the true apostolic gift revealed in Acts 1. But Paul discloses his very different version from the original gift of tongues in the following quote, and please note how strikingly similar it is to the "spirit of Python" and her interpreters:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">"If any man speak in<strong><em> an unknown tongue</em></strong>, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that in turn; and <em><strong>let one interpret.</strong></em>" (<a href="http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/14-27.htm">1 Cor. 14:27 KJV</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">We all are also familiar that when speaking in unintelligible sounds begins at church, sometimes the speaker and sometime others lose all control of their bodies, and start rolling in the aisles. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul, I hate to say it, appears to have introduced demonic practices of the occult into the church.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, one must wonder if Paul's stinger in the flesh from an "Angel of Satan" in 2 Cor. 12:7 impaled him somehow with Satan's spirit of Python -- what Paul unwittingly reveals when he describes the glossalia-spirit, of which Paul says in very modest terms (I am being facetious):</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">When I was asked on May 10, 2020 about the gift of the spirit, and what I thought about them, I took a chance and shared the Python Priestess evidence.

<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">EKHIDNA (or Echidna) was a monstrous she-dragon (drakaina) with the head and breast of a woman. She probably represented or presided over the corruptions of the earth : rot, slime, fetid waters, illness and disease.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">She was often equated with Python (the rotting one), a dragon born of the fetid slime left behind by the great Deluge. Others call her the Tartarean lamprey, and assigned her to the dark, swampy pit of Tartaros beneath the earth. Hesiod, makes her a daughter of monstrous sea-gods, and presumably associates her with rotting sea-scum and fetid salt-marshes. </span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">In all cases, she was described as the consort of Typhoeus, a monstrous storm-daemon who challenged Zeus in heaven. Together they spawned a host of terrible monsters to plague the earth.</span></div>

<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Grace greetings, I stumbled through your apologies when I was looking at Python Spirit exegesis. I will recommend you check out&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gospelofchristministrues.org/">www.gospelofchristministries.org</a>&nbsp;of Dr. Shawn Smith and you will see a clear right division of before and after the Cross which will prove to you the apostle <strong>Paul is the Apostle to the church today</strong> and the differences between Jesus before &amp; post resurrection. You will<strong> rethink your stance</strong> against Pauline epistles and shall be rightly taught on numerous subjects especially on salvation by faith Alone. Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Hi Brother Raymond</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">The site you provided makes the following statement under <a href="https://www.gospelofchristministries.org/project/theosis/">Theosis </a>which proves the importance that the Python Priestess in Acts 16 when still possessed by a demon endorsed Paul's "way of salvation":</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; padding-left: 30px;">It is without exaggeration to say that apart from the Saviour, the Apostle Paul is the greatest benefactor to the human race because the Lord<span style="font-weight: bold;"> used him to give us the most advanced teachings</span>. When you see what was revealed to Paul, what motivated him will begin to motivate you. There is no other way the desire to go out and fulfil this grace mandate can infuse you except by you receiving the same things that the Lord Jesus Christ revealed to the apostle Paul; what made him a great theologian and at the same time a great missionary.</p>
<p><cite style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; color: #595959;">&nbsp;</cite></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Thus, the author of Theosis believes Paul came with a <strong>different more advanced</strong> Gospel than Jesus taught the 12. This is clearly a sign that <strong>the Python Priestess passage explains why this was true</strong>. The most influential demon spirit of Paul's age endorsed Paul's "way of salvation" for many days, and Paul did nothing until finally he cast the demon out of her.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">(Paul never quotes Jesus giving him a revelation other than 2 Cor. 12:7 where the Damascus Jesus refuses Paul's request to release him from the torment by an "angel of Satan" -- which Paul defenders say we should ignore, because Paul could not possibly mean what this implies about our Jesus leaving Paul under a demon's influence. See <a href="/recommendedreading/666-how-many-times-do-episltes-of-paul-uniquely-quote-jesus.html">our article</a> on this passage.)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Hence, what this quote from Theosis proves is that the author realizes Paul's gospel is more "<strong>advanced</strong>" (different) than Jesus' gospel which was supposedly '<strong>less advanced</strong>.' The explanation for this difference is right there in Acts 16 - Paul taught a gospel "way of salvation" that demons approved.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Also, we see the difference by comparing what Theosis regards as the "less advanced" Jesus' Gospel which teaches, for example, that works worthy of repentance are necessary to appease the one you offended prior to you or I bringing our atonement offering -- Christ's blood -- to God to cover ourselves -- <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A23-26&amp;version=TLB">Matt 5:23-26 TLB</a>, versus Paul's more "advanced" teaching that if you merely "believe Jesus died for your sins and rose from the dead you shall be saved" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor.+15%3A1-5&amp;version=KJV">1 Cor. 15:1-5.</a>) But the demons believe such things, and cannot be saved. James deduced therefore that such a "faith alone does not justify" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+2%3A17%2C+24&amp;version=KJV">James 2:17, 24</a> (faith alone -- without works - is dead; and by works, and not by faith alone, is a man justified.). Hence, the role of the Python Priestess in Acts 16 perfectly explains this material difference -- the true Gospel of Salvation which Jesus taught versus the Gospel of Salvation that Paul taught which <strong>THE MOST INFLUENTIAL DEMON OF THAT ERA ENDORSED TO PAUL'S GREAT ADVANCEMENT IN THE EYES OF PAGANS.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Blessings of Christ,</p>
