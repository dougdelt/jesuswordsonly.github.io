<td valign="top">
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Blogs notoriously disappear, and great articles are lost. Below is a very good short and sweet presentation why Paul is a "False Apostle." The author raises a couple of points I have not, and thus it is a different perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><a href="http://end-times-blog.blogspot.com/2010/06/was-paul-apostle.html">End Times Blog</a></span><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">End Time Events From A Christian Perspective</span></p>
<hr />
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Saturday, June 19, 2010</span><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Was Paul A False Apostle</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">After many years as a Christian not really understanding Paul (or Saul) I asked God for understanding about Paul and whether he is or was a real apostle. Here is what God revealed to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Point One - There Is No Witness - There Are Only Twelve Apostles</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">All through his epistles Paul stridently claims that he is an apostle appointed by Jesus Christ himself. But elsewhere in the Bible (not including Paul's epistles) the Bible is silent. There are only twelve appointed apostles mentioned elsewhere, not thirteen. Nowhere else in the bible is there any confirmation that Paul is in fact an apostle. The Bible requires a witness before we are to believe anybody. The only witness Paul has is himself. He only claims his 'signs and wonders' as his witness. But Jesus has explicity warned us not to accept 'signs and wonders' as a witness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Point Two - Paul's Account Is Contrary To Jesus' Explicit Warnings</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">We know from Acts that Jesus appeared to the apostles after his resurrection before returning to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">It was not long after this that he was taken up into the sky while they were watching., and he disappeared into a cloud. As they were straining their eyes to see him, two white robed men suddenly stood there among them. They said, "Men of Galilee, why are you standing there staring at the sky. Jesus has been taken away from you into heaven and someday, just as you saw him go, he will return." Acts 1:9-11</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This is reiterated in the psalms:</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit in honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies, making them a footstool under your feet". Psalm 110:1</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus himself also spoke of this, that at the end of the age he will appear on the clouds in great glory:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And then at last the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the heavens, and there will be a deep mourning among all the nations of the earth. And they will see the Son of Man arrive on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send forth his angels with the sound of a mighty trumpet blast, and they will gather together his chosen ones from the farthest ends of the earth and heaven. Mathew 34:30-31</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The message from the Bible is very clear: that Jesus has ascended to the father and is sitting at his right hand in heaven, waiting until he returns to earth at the end of the age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus warned us about anyone who claimed to see him before his glorious return at the end of the age:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Then if anyone tells you, 'Look here is the Messiah,' or 'There he is,' don't pay any attention. For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform great miraculous signs and wonders so as to deceive, if possible, even God's chosen ones. See I have warned you.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">So if someone tells you, 'Look the Messiah is out in the desert,' don't bother to go and look. Or, 'Look he is hiding here,' don't believe it. For as the lightning lights up the entire sky, so it will be when the Son of Man returns. Mathew 24:23-27</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus is telling us that when he returns to earth it will be clear and unmistakable to everyone, and that we are not to believe any other accounts of people who claim to have seen the Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul, completely contrary to Jesus' account claims to have seen Jesus by the side of the road leading to Damascus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">As he was nearing Damascus on this mission, a brilliant light from heaven suddenly beamed down upon him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him "Saul Saul why do you persecute me".</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"Who are you sir?' Saul asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And the voice replied, "I am Jesus the one you are persecuting! Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you are to do." Acts 9:3-6</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Now while it was a startling event, Paul's account is completely contrary to Jesus' explicit warning to the apostles. Jesus' warning could be restated:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Or, if somebody tells you, 'I saw him by the side of the road leading to Damascus,' don't believe him.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Note that Acts was written by Luke, a follower of Paul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Point Three - Paul Does Not Meet The Requirements For Being An Apostle</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Peter clearly set down God's requirements for apostleship at the time that Mathias was chosen as apostle to replace Judas:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Peter continued. "This was predicted in the book of Psalms, where it says, 'Let his house become desolate, with no one living in it.' And again, 'Let his position be given to someone else.'"</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"So now we must chose another man to take Judas's place. It must be someone who has been with us all the time that we were with the Lord Jesus- from the time he was baptised by John until the day he was taken from us into heaven. Whoever is chosen will join us as a witness to Jesus resurrection." Acts 1:20-22</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul cannot possibly fulfill these requirements. So was Peter wrong, or is Paul not an apostle?</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Point Four - Paul Acted Independently From The Apostles</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul by his own admission states that he did not visit Jerusalem until three years after his 'conversion' experience, and that he returned a second time fourteen years later.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">It was not until three years later that I finally went to Jerusalem for a visit with Peter and stayed with him fifteen days. And the only other apostle I met at that time was James, our Lords brother. Galatians 1:18-19</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">One day after I returned to Jerusalem, I was praying in the Temple, and I fell into a trance. I saw a vision of Jesus saying to me, 'Hurry! Leave Jerusalem, for the people here won't believe you when you give your testimony about me.'</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">'But Lord,' I argued, 'they certainly know that I imprisoned and beat those in every synagogue who believed in you. And when your witness Stephen was killed, I was standing there agreeing. I kept the coats they laid aside as they stoned him.'</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">But the Lord said to me, 'Leave Jerusalem, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.' Acts 22:17-21</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The fourteen years later I went back to Jerusalem again, this time with Barnabus, and Titus came along too. Acts 2:1</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul by his own admission had almost no contact with the twelve apostles. Interestingly Paul's spirit guide pulled him out of Jerusalem, <strong>rather than have Paul's teaching exposed to the scrutiny of the apostles</strong>, and those who had actually heard and seen Jesus. It is likely that had Paul stayed in Jerusalem he would have been found out. Paul was kept isolated from the apostles and the other believers living in Jerusalem so that they were not properly aware of his activities and his doctrine. The Gentiles had little or no background knowledge of the scriptures, and little or no exposure to Jesus' teaching, so that they would have been much easier to deceive than the believers in Jerusalem. Very very few Gentiles would have actually heard or seen Jesus. And we know that Paul's teachings did clash with the Gentiles who did know about Jesus, such as Apollos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul even split with Baranbas:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">After some time Paul said to Barnabas, 'Lets return to each city where we previously preached the word of the lord, to see how the new believers Are getting along.' Barnabas agreed and wanted to take along John Mark. But Paul disagreed strongly since John Mark had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not shared in their work. Their disagreement over this was so sharp that they separated. Acts15:36-39</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul was the original lone ranger. He acted completely independently of the twelve, and relied entirely on his own personal revelation, whatever that was.This is entirely inconsistent with God's careful choosing and training of the twelve.It would also be out of God's character for God to blind side Peter and the apostles in ths way. God appointing Paul in this way would imply a severe reprimand to Peter and the apostles, and a lack of trust in them.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Point Five - Only One Of Paul's Gentile Churches Listed In Revelation</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul himself claimed to be God's chosen apostle to the Gentiles. However, the list of seven churches in Revelation only includes one church which Paul had visited, the church in Ephesus. According to Acts, there was already a Christian church in Ephesus when Paul first visited. Paul and Barnabus visited Ephesus claiming to be apostles. Interestingly, the message to Ephesus in Revelation refers to false apostles:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I know all the things you do. I have seen your hard work and your patient endurance. I know you don't tolerate evil people. You have examined the claims of those who say they are apostles but are not. You have discovered they are liars. Revelation 2:2</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">There is no direct link to Paul, but Paul and Barnabus are the only people mentioned in Acts who visited Ephesus while claiming to be apostles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Point Six - Conflict Between The Gospel Of Paul And The Gospel Of Apollos</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Apollos was baptised by the holy spirit in Ephesus (Acts 18:24), then moved to Corinth (Acts 19:1). We read in Paul's letters to the Corinthians about conflict between the gospel of Apollos and the gospel of Paul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Some of you are saying, "I am a follower of Paul." Others are saying, "I follow Apollos," or "I follow Peter," or "I follow only Christ." 1Corinthians 1:12</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This seems to indicate that their were different teachings by Apollos and Paul.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Point Seven - Paul's Teachings Directly Contradicted By James</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In James letter he directly contradicts two of Paul's teachings. Firstly on faith:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Don't you remember that our ancestor Abraham was declared right with God because of what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the alter? You see he was trusting God so much that he was willing to do whatever God told him to do. James 2:21</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">On salvation:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Do you still think it's enough just to believe that there is one God. Well even the demons believe this, and they tremble in terror. James 2:19</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Compare with Paul's teaching on faith and salvation:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, 'the righteous shall live by faith.' Romans 1:17</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">For if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved. Romans 10:9-10</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The gospel is good news for those who repent of their sins and turn to a life of faithful obedience to God. Paul's teaching is the root of Arminianism: that we are saved simply because we believe in Jesus resurrection, and confess that we believe. God demands that we act in obedience to him, not that we simply display some esoteric 'faith'. The faith that God requires is 'faithful' obedience to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Point Eight - Paul's Epistles Are The Origin Of Virtually Every Christian Heresy</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Virtually every Christian heresy can be traced back to an interpretation (or so-called misinterpretation) of Paul's epistles. Some argue that the fault is with those who 'misinterpret' Paul. My belief is that Satan deliberately used a complicated and obscure gospel message through Paul so that the error could not be easily discerned. Satan is trying to deceive, and in order to deceive you have to be dishonest and cunning. It is too easy to exhonerate Paul and blame others for the error that is hidden in his gospel (Paul called his gospel my gospel).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">If Paul is in fact a real apostle why is Paul's teaching so open to misinterpretation? Does God not speak plainly?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Point Nine - Paul Is An Arrogant Egoist</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In his epistles, Paul writes constantly about himself, his gospel, his apostleship, and his personal revelation from Jesus. He boasts that he is equal if not superior to the 'other' apostles. He boasts about dressing down Peter in pulblic, instead of speaking privately with him. That is a just a very wordly and devious ploy to avoid talking to Peter about Peters concerns over Pauls teaching (attack is the best defense).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">He misrepresented the outcome of the Jerusalem Council to the churches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">When on trial before the Council, he reverts to a subterfuge to avoid discussing his teaching. Instead he changes the subject to the resurrection (Paul was arrested after Trophimus, a Gentile Greek from Paul's church in Ephesus had entered the Jewish section of the Temple where Gentiles were forbidden to enter). The council would presumabley have been very interested to know about Paul's teaching, as Trophimus was a member of Paul's church. Instead of explaining his teaching Paul used a subterfuge to create an uproar amongst the Council over the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul has displayed himeself as a tricky character. Hardly what we should expect from an apostle. Certainly not an imitator of the character of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Having said that, the modern day, self proclaimed apostles would outdo even Paul with their shameless and arrogant disregard for God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Point Ten - Funny Doctrine and Outright Error In Paul's Teachings</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Pauls letters are full of funny teaching and errors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Baptism for the dead.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Woman covering their hair for the sake of the angels.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Misunderstanding the nature of Melkizidek. He was a Priest King. King of Salem (Jerusalem) and Priest of the most high God. Jesus will also fill this double role of King and High Priest when he returns.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">That loving others is the fulfillment of all God's commandments. The bible is clear that we are to love God first, with all our mind, spirit, and soul, AND our neighbour as ourself. Loving others is secondary to loving God.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This is from an apostle who had no direct contact with Jesus teachings, and yet claims to be not only an apostle, but a superior apostle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Point Ten - Pauls Conversion Is Out Of Character For God</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Pauls account of his conversion implies that God forcibly converted him, almost against his will. Paul was blinded for three days before he received his sight. How many Christians would there be in the world today if God used the same approach on everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">But that is contrary to God's plan. God could force everyone in the world to obey him, but he deliberately does not do that. God is searching for those with a true heart, who will obey him without being forced to, because those are the people God can trust foir eternity. Those are the people that God wants to share heaven with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">While Paul's conversion was dramatic, it was not in God's character to convert Paul in that way. It was also not in God's character to go behind the backs of the apostles in Jerusalem, and appoint Paul over their heads to preach to the Gentiles. That would have been a huge reprimand to the apostles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">My conclusion:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul is a satanically inspired tare who was planted into the early christian church. The light that Paul encountered by the side of the road to Damascus was Satan himself or one of Satan's angels. Paul has preached another gospel, filling up Christianity with false tare churches and false tare believers. Paul's requirements for salvation are much easier than God's requirements (you just have to believe), so that the tares are far more numerous than the true followers of Yeshuah (Jesus). Modern Christianity is built on Paul, not on Jesus the rock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul's tare church has succeeded in choking and ovecrowding God's real church, just as weeds choke the good plants in our gardens. But this is also part of God's plan. <strong>God is using Paul and Satan to help thresh the harvest, and to help him separate the wheat from the chaff. God will only gather the real wheat into his barn</strong>. Satan is helping God to achieve that. Isn't God wise?</span></p>

Paul wasn't one of Jesus' real apostles. He said he caught people with trickery. He contradicts God himself when he says it is good for a man not to touch a woman. You follow Paul because of your indoctrination. Why don't you do the intellectually honest thing and look into it? Would life as you know it cease to exist if Paul was a false prophet? What does you salvation have to do with Paul? Why don't you just follow Jesus only instead? Paul didn't die for your sins. Would you lose your entire faith in Jesus and in God and in your salvation if Paul's writings were all thrown out? What do you think Paul said that Jesus didn't say, that might negatively affect your salvation if Paul and his teachings disappeared entirely?

Most here seem to be followers of Paul instead of Jesus. And like you said if Paul's strange teachings were thrown out of the Bible then what would be left of what they believe. Paul taught a different gospel than what the 12 Apostles and what Jesus taught. Yes, like I said before, some of Paul's teachings fall in line with what Jesus taught but lots of what Paul taught does not line up with what Jesus taught. I saw it the first time I read the Bible and continue to see the problems with Paul's teachings to this very day.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" /><br style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Like Furchizedek said it is my opinion that Paul was a false apostle. Jesus selected the 12 Apostles and taught them three and a half years. Paul said he had a vision but had no witnesses that saw the same vision. Saul tried to destroy the Christian movement by imprisoning and killing Christians. When Saul changed his name to Paul he tried to destroy the Christian movement by distorting the true message of Jesus. In other words if he could not destroy Christans by imprisoniong them he would destory them by distorting the truth of the Bible. I don't see much place in the Bible for a murderer to have to try to teach anyone what Jesus really stood for and taught. Would think Jesus would be fully capable of doing this. Don't think Jesus would have selected a murdered to teach His Word and be His Apostle. There were too many good people around for Jesus to have to rely on a murderer to do His work.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" /><br style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Like I said before some seem to have been blinded by the teachings of Paul. They quote Paul more than Jesus or the 12 Apostles. In the traditional sense Paul could never be considered an Apostle because Jesus did not select Paul and never, ever, taught him like He taught the 12 true Apostles.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" /><br style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I noticed someone said Paul was a very wise man and I will have to agree with that statement. Satan was also wise but his wisdom was used for evil purposes. His wisdom was not Godly wisdom.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
