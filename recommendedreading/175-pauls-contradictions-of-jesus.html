<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a id="idolmeat"></a>Jesus Says Not To Eat Meat Sacrificed to Idols, But Paul Says It Is Ok&nbsp;</strong></span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Three times Jesus in the Book of Revelation condemns eating meat sacrificed to idols, even saying this is the doctrine of a false prophet. (Rev.<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%202:6&amp;version=NIV"> 2:6</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%202:14&amp;version=NIV">14</a> (Ephesus);&nbsp;Rev. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%202:14&amp;version=NIV">2:14</a>-15 (Pergamum);&nbsp;Revelation <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%202:20&amp;version=NIV">2:20</a> (Thyatira).)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">This absolute prescription also was set forth in James' ruling at the&nbsp;Jerusalem Council in Acts <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2015:20&amp;version=NIV">15:20</a>. Then it is repeated when it was put in a letter.&nbsp;(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2015:29&amp;version=NIV">Acts 15:29</a>.) Finally, James reiterates this for a third and final time in Acts chapter 21. James tells Paul that many claim Paul is teaching lawless doctrine -- "apostasia." (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21.</a>) So James reminds Paul what was the ruling at the Jerusalem Council. He tells Paul that previously "we wrote giving judgment that they [<em>i.e</em>., the Gentiles] should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols...." (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2021:25&amp;version=NIV">Acts 21:25</a>.) James asks Paul to reassure everyone that Paul believes the Law is still valid by Paul performing the vow from Numbers chapter six. Paul agrees, impliedly leading James to assume Paul never wavered from the principle that it is unlawful to eat meat sacrificed to idols. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">However, Paul clearly teaches multiple times that there is nothing wrong in itself eating meat sacrificed to idols.&nbsp; Paul reasoned that a "strong" conscience knows an idol is nothing. Thus, eating meat sacrificed to nothing can have no consequences. Those who thought otherwise Paul says were "weak" minded in thinking the fact an idol was involved meant eating meat sacrificed to an "idol" made it wrong to do so.&nbsp; (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%208:4-13&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 8:4-13</a>, and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2010:19-29&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 10:19-29</a>. See also&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 24px;">Romans&nbsp;</span><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014:21&amp;version=NIV" style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 24px;">14:21</a>.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="color: #494a44; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 24px;">Why did Paul devote so much time, and take the risk endorsing eating idol meat unless you were in the presence of such a "weak" minded brother?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="color: #494a44; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 24px;">Well, idol temples apparently gave such meat away free to anyone who would come to the idol's temple after the sacrifice to sit and enjoy the feast of meats. Such feasts were a primary way the public enjoyed any game-meat. So this was an important teaching by Paul which would attract poor followers to Paul's doctrines. Obviously, others in the church, including the Jerusalem council of the 12 Apostles in Acts 15, had the opposite view.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The first time Paul addresses the question of "eating meat sacrificed to idols," Paul answers: "But food will not commend us to God; neither if we eat not...." (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%208:8-9&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 8:8</a>.) Paul then explained it is only necessary to abstain from eating such meat if you are around a "weaker" brother who thinks an idol is something. (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%208:7&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 8:7</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%208:10&amp;version=NIV">8:10</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%209:22&amp;version=NIV">9:22</a>.) Then, and only then, must you abstain. The reason is that then a brother might be emboldened to do something he thinks is sinful. The brother is "</span><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">weak," Paul says, for believing eating meat sacrificed to an idol is wrong. This is thus a sin for the "weak" brother to eat, Paul explains, even though you know it is not sinful to eat meat sacrificed to idols. Thus, even though you know better than your weaker brother that it is no sin to eat such meat (1 Cor 10:28-29), it is better to abstain eating at the idol's temple in his presence than cause a "brother" to sin against his weak conscience and become "perished" (lost) / "destroyed." (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%208:11&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 8:11</a>.)&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In saying this, Paul clearly implied it was alright to eat at the idol's temple if no weak-minded brother was around. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">First, in&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+8%3A4-12&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 8:10</a>, Paul said: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">For <strong>if any man see <span style="color: #ff0000;">thee</span> which has knowledge <span style="color: #ff0000;">sit at meat in the idol's temple</span></strong>, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols: &amp; through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom Christ died? But when ye sin so against the brethren and would their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. (KJV). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Please notice that Paul does not condemn going to the idol's temple to eat if no "weak" minded Christian is able to see you doing so. You only decline if the circumstances render it disadvantageous to eat -- when you can be seen by a so-called "weak"-minded brother eating such meat at the idol's temple, you thereby do harm to the "weak" brother's will-power to not violate his own conscience.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Incidentally, obviously Paul restricted the circumstances when one impliedly could eat such meat at the idol's temple only to a time period after the pagan ceremony was over. At that point, the food now represented, in Paul's explanation that an "idol" is "nothing," just a free meal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Finally, Paul makes it clear that in the absence of any Christian with a "weak" conscience being in eye-shot, you with a "strong" conscience could eat such meat without any self-reproach.&nbsp; For in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+10%3A28-29&amp;version=KJV">1 Cor. 10:28-29</a> KJV, Paul says:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt; padding-left: 60px;">28 But if someone says to you, &ldquo;This has been offered in sacrifice,&rdquo; then do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience. 29 I am referring to the <strong>other person&rsquo;s conscience, not yours</strong>. For <strong>why is my freedom being judged by another&rsquo;s conscience? </strong></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Paul elsewhere calls this a "freedom in Christ" from having to obey any of the Torah-law.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">In Galatians, Paul refers to those claiming to be brethren who were trying to "spy out <strong>our liberty which we have in Christ</strong> that they might <strong>bring us into bondage</strong>." <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm">Gal. 2:4</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Did Paul mean the 12 apostles who stood directly against eating idol meat at the Jerusalem Conference in Acts 15, and now had discovered Paul's teaching?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Luther said Paul meant that those 'spying out our liberty' in Gal. 2:4 were agents of the 12 Apostles. Paul supposedly correctly stood against the 12 due to their concern that Paul should follow at least the Torah laws given at the Jerusalem conference for them (which included not eating idol meat). Paul calls all such Torah laws "bondage" in Galatians. Luther thought Paul justly in this dispute called the 12 of "no repute," and only "seemed to be somewhat," and Paul was right to say their church-positions "made no difference to me," and what they revealed "in <strong>conference</strong>&nbsp;[Acts 15 Jersalem conference on idol meat?]&nbsp;<strong>added nothing to me</strong>." (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gal.+2%3A6&amp;version=NIV">Gal. 2:6</a>.) For more background, see <a href="/web/20210303174615/https://jesuswordsonly.com/recommendedreading/436-paul-knew-the-12-taught-another-jesus.html">Paul Believed 12 Followed Another Jesus Per Luther</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">Obviously, the most burning difference that supposedly justified Paul's ire was this issue about eating meat sacrificed to idols. His followers <strong>wanted reassurance they could eat it</strong>. Paul knew his adherents would be less inclined to follow Paul if he had to abandon teaching an "idol" is nothing, and instead had to concede that food sacrificed to an idol is "something" more than an issue whether an idol is real or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 18pt;">By contrast, the 12 apostles previously made clear they wanted Gentiles to obey this Law. This was part of the list of starter laws that all Gentiles must obey that was issued at the Jerusalem Conference in Acts 15. Paul was tasked to deliver this ruling to the leadership at the Gentile-dominated church at Antioch, Syria.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">This question indeed was a "major controversy," as&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><em>Wikipedia</em>&nbsp;records:&nbsp;</span><br/></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Those who favor Paul admit that Paul contradicts Jesus in Revelation where Jesus three times prohibits eating meat sacrificed to idols. However, they believe Apostle John was expressing <strong>hatred</strong> toward Paul, thereby discounting that Jesus validly was speaking. The Christian scholar, Renan, in his famous work <em><strong>Saint Paul</strong> </em>(G.W. Carleton, 1875) at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://books.google.com/books?id=NN8TAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=intitle%3ASaint%20intitle%3APaul%20inauthor%3ARenan&amp;pg=PA220#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">220 </a>admits all this: </span></p>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>CAVEAT</strong>: The Law given Moses applicable to "foreigners/sojourners" (Gentiles) is a relatively small set of moral commands primarily from Leviticus, incorporating most of the Ten Commandments. So if the Law given Moses applies to Gentiles, it is not a burdensome list. Yet, we are still applying literally the Law, just as James did in Acts 15, by treating the term "foreigner/sojourners" versus "sons of Israel" as literally as possible. This distinction perfectly explains why James in Acts 15 did not extend circumcision to Gentiles to become followers, <em>i.e.</em>, Leviticus <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus%2012:1-3&amp;version=KJV">12:1-3</a> only requires sons of "Israel" to be circumcised except if a gentile wanted to observe passover or enter the Temple.&nbsp;See this <a href="/web/20210303174615/https://jesuswordsonly.com/recommendedreading/98-law-applicable-today.html">webpage</a> where we discuss this issue in more depth.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Jesus's View on the Law</strong>. Jesus emphasized the validity of the Law up through the passing away of Heaven and Earth, thus confirming its inspiration and ongoing validity. In Matthew <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:17-19&amp;version=ASV">5:17-19</a> we read:</span></p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">(17) Think not that I came to destroy<em><strong> the Law [of Moses] </strong></em>or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil. (18) For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in&nbsp;<strong><em>no wise pass away from the Law</em></strong>, till all things be accomplished [<em>i.e.</em>, all things predicted appear on the stage of history].&nbsp;(19) Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and<em> <strong>shall teach men so</strong></em><strong>,</strong> shall be called&nbsp;<strong><em>least</em></strong> in the kingdom of heaven: but&nbsp;<strong><em>whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great </em></strong>in the kingdom of heaven. (ASV)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Compare that Luke 16:17 similarly records Jesus saying at a different time than the Sermon on the Mount:</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"> "It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law." (Luke<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+16&amp;version=NIV" style="color: #517291; text-decoration: underline; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium; line-height: 21px;">&nbsp;16:16</a>-17 NIV.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, Jesus can never be accused of seducing any Christian from following the Law. Jesus cannot be a false prophet under&nbsp;Deuteronomy <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy%2013:5&amp;version=KJV">13:5</a> (false prophet is anyone who has miracles and wonders but seduces you from following the Law). Jesus said the Law remained valid until the Heavens and Earth pass away. This passing of heaven and earth occurs at the end of the Millennium. This is 1000 years after Christ's Second Coming, according to the Book of Revelation.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Paul's View on the Law</strong>. Paul says the opposite.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul in Romans 10:4 say "For Christ is the <strong>end</strong> of the Law for righteousness for everyone who believes." Paul is blunt the Law has ceased for anyone who follows Jesus in Ephesians 2:15, Colossians 2:14, 2 Cor. 3:11-17, Romans<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom.%207:13&amp;version=ASV"> 7:1-3</a> et seq, and Galatians 3:19 et seq. The Law is "abolished," "done away with," "nailed to a tree," "has faded away,' and was "only ordained by angels...who are no gods." </span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">If we were to cite Paul's condemnations of the Law in one string, the point is self-evident that Paul abrogated the Law for everyone.

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Finally, in Romans<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A1-6&amp;version=NKJV"> 7:1-6</a>, Paul claims when Jesus died, the husband died and this dissolved the Law's bonds between the husband (God of Sinai) and wife (God's people). This henceforth made the "law dead to us." (Romans <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207:4&amp;version=NKJV">7:4</a>.) This death-of-God-the-husband released the Jews, Paul contends, and when Christ resurrected the bonds of marriage with the old God were not renewed. &nbsp;(The implication, we contend, was Paul meant a new God emerges or otherwise if the same husband-God resurrected, why wasn't the bond to the Law renewed? Paulinists come near to admitting this is the only <em>logical</em> meaning while even confessing they are uncomfortable with the passage's 'seemingly' polytheistic explanation... Uggh. On our thorough analysis of Romans 7:1-6, see our&nbsp;<a href="/web/20210303174615/https://jesuswordsonly.com/recommendedreading/167-romans-7-a-major-incongruity.html">webpage</a> discussion.)</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Paul Says The Pharisees Followed The Law Rigorously, <a id="phariseesarerigorous"></a>But Jesus Says They Were Lax About The Law</span></strong></span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul says in Philippians <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians%203:5-6&amp;version=KJV">3:5-6</a> that as a result of his time as a Pharisee that "as touching righteousness,&nbsp;<strong><em>found blameless</em></strong>." Cf. Acts <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2026:5&amp;version=NIV">26:5</a> where Paul says "I conformed to the strictest sect of our religion, living as a Pharisee."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Of course, Jesus taught contrarily that the Pharisees were lax in teaching and obeying the Law. See Matt. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2023:23&amp;version=KJV">23:23</a>.&nbsp;<em>See also</em>, Matt. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2015:6,9&amp;version=KJV">15: 6,9.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">This contradiction between Paul and Jesus has probably had the most important impact on doctrine. By perceiving the Pharisees through Paul's eyes, we are led to believe Jesus condemned the Pharisees as legalists -- Paul's view. However, Jesus condemned the Pharisees as<em><strong> ANTI-LEGALISTS</strong></em>. Jesus condemned them as teachers abrogating the Law by their man-made ordinances. (Matt. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2015:6,9&amp;version=KJV">15:6</a>). And Jesus condemned them as those who taught the lesser commands of the Law while ignoring the more weightier commands of the Law of justice (right-and-wrong), mercy and faith / obedience (pistis in Greek has a dual meaning). (Matt. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2023:23&amp;version=KJV">23:23</a>.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, a wrong deduction is achieved by using Paul's contradictory perception of the Pharisees. Paul says the Pharisees are<strong><em> legalists</em></strong>; but Jesus says they are <em><strong>anti-legalists</strong></em>. Negators of the Mosaic Law. These are <strong>radically opposite perceptions</strong>. If Paul's view were correct, then Jesus impliedly condemned obedience any longer to the Law by criticizing the Pharisees. However, if Jesus's view of the Pharisees as lax about the Law is correct (and who can deny our Lord's veracity!), then Jesus condemned any teaching that either marginalized the Law or contradicted the Law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">This fits precisely into Jesus's statement:&nbsp;"he that teaches and keeps the Law of Moses <em><strong>will be great</strong></em> in the kingdom of heaven." (Matt.<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%205:19&amp;version=KJV"> 5:19</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">However, because Paul depicts the Pharisees - enemies of Jesus - as law-keepers, Paul is understood to be "condemning all who are zealous of the Law of Moses as an enemy of Messiah." (Cosette,&nbsp;<em>Id.</em>, at 21.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">This means Paul indirectly<strong><em> condemned our Lord Jesus Christ</em></strong> when Paul condemned those who were teaching the Law should be followed, both big and little commands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>CAVEAT</strong>: Please note that I have explained that the Law does not have but a relatively modest number of provisions that apply to non-Israelites/sojourners. It has provisions that specifically extend rules to sojourners/non-Israelites who join with the community. When they apply to both, specifically on the atonement principle, &nbsp;the Law says they are "one" principle that applies to both. It does not say there is "one law" -- all five books -- that applies the same without any distinction between "sons of Israel" and "sojourners." For that would render null the Law's own distinction between the two. Hence, the "one law" verse is taken out of context.

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">NOTE: Incidentally, in the Reformation, Melancthon, Bucer and later apparently Luther came to teach double justification. This interpreted Paul as saying our salvation initiates by faith, but is maintained by works, including repentance. See our book, JWOS <a href="/web/20210303174615/https://jesuswordsonly.com/images/stories/Salvation/preface specially formatted.pdf">Preface</a> (PDF). For a very good defense of this notion, using Paul's present v. past tense reference to saved, see this<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.christian-history.org/not-by-faith-alone.html"> webpage</a> from Christian History.org. However, Jesus says salvation initiates, such as for the Prodigal, by repentance from sin combined with faith in the father, while Paul contrarily says that it initiates by faith alone without a hint of any repentance from sin. Hence, double justification may be a plausible synthesis of Paul and Jesus on a few verses, &nbsp;but it is not adopted today because Jesus' and Paul's words directly clash, requiring an either/or choice.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 18pt;">Jesus <a id="teachpreascension2"></a>Tells Apostles To Teach His Commands Given Prior to His Ascension While In The Flesh, &nbsp;But Paul Says Not To Do So (Per Bultmann's Reading)</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">After the Risen Lord proved He had the same nail holes as He had on the cross, Jesus' final words just before He ascended into heaven were that the Apostles should teach "<strong><em>everything that I commanded you</em></strong>...." Matt. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt.%2028:20&amp;version=NIV">28:20</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Jesus must have meant to teach all His commands prior to the Cross, and not simply any given after He rose from the dead and prior to Ascension. How do we know that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The reason we know this is true is because none of the four gospels contain any post-cross commands. If Jesus meant by His command to teach the world "all that I have commanded you" (Matt. 28:20) to teach only His commands <strong><em>post-resurrection</em></strong>, the four gospels would have contained such commands. However, there are none quoted except the command in Matt. 28:20 to teach Jesus' commands previously given. Hence, Jesus clearly meant by "everything I commanded you" to be His words in His earthly ministry <strong><em>before His resurrection</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, Jesus could only have meant that post-Ascension the apostles were to teach the <strong><em>pre-Cross teachings of Jesus</em></strong> -- while He was clearly "in the flesh."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">However, Paul's statement in 2 Corinthians 5:16 is interpreted to justify rejecting this.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><sup>16</sup>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though <em><strong>we have known Christ after the flesh</strong></em>, yet now <strong><em>henceforth know we him no more</em></strong>. (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:16-17&amp;version=KJV">KJV</a>)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The famous and influential evangelical theologian Rudolf Bultmann said 2 Corinthians 5:16 means we no longer know Christ in the flesh,&nbsp;<em>i.e.</em>, we supposedly can dispense with Jesus's teachings when He was in the flesh. Paul tells us that only the messages Paul received from the resurrected Christ -- who supposedly no longer had flesh -- is the means to know Christ any longer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Read this way by Bultmann, Paul tells us we no longer know or need to know Jesus' message delivered pre-Resurrection when He was in the flesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">This is also how the Christian theologian and physician&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer">Albert Schweitzer</a> (1875-1965) viewed 2 Cor. 5:16 in his book of 1911&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://archive.org/details/MN41519ucmf_2"><em>Geschichte Der Paulinischen Forschung </em></a>(J. C. B. Mohr) [Archive.org] at 191 (and in English translation,&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://archive.org/details/paulandhisinterp00schwuoft"><em>Paul and His Interpreters: </em><em>The conception of authority in the Pauline writings</em> (1918) at 36</a>.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Schweitzer explained: "since the death and resurrection of the Lord [Paul believed] conditions were present that were so <strong><em>wholly new</em></strong> that they <em><strong>made his [Jesus's] teaching inapplicable</strong></em><em>.</em>" (<em>Id</em>.) Thus, Albert Schweitzer says this is what explains Paul's failure to mention any significant teachings of Jesus: "If we had only St Paul to guide us, we should not know that Jesus spoke in&nbsp;parables, that He spoke the Sermon on the Mount and taught His people the Lord's Prayer."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Indeed, with the sole exception of the eucharistic formula at 1 Cor 11:24-25, Paul does not quote any sayings of the historical Jesus as found in the written Gospels. Furthermore, Paul never even once alludes to the panorama of the Savior's life story from the Nativity up to the Passion, as well as Jesus's elaborate teaching, which fill the pages of the first four books of the New Testament.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">By contrast, and astonishingly, at Acts 13:<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2013:24-25&amp;version=NIV">24-25</a> Paul does quote <em>John the Baptist from the written gospels</em>! And Paul in Acts quotes pagan Greek works more frequently than Jesus's words from the gospels (which only clearly once he did - the quote of the communion liturgy). See our article <a href="/web/20210303174615/https://jesuswordsonly.com/recommendedreading/300-pagan-influences-in-writings-of-paul.html">Pagan Influences on Pau</a>l. Hence, Paul was&nbsp;a well-read man but never thought Christ's teachings in the flesh which we find in the gospels were of any importance to relate to the Romans, Corinthians, Ephesians, Thessalonians, etc. He rather quote pagan writers, so it seems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">As a result, Bultmann saw things the same way as did Albert Schweitzer. As one commentator on Bultmann summarized his influential view of 2 Corinthians 5:16, Paul deliberately ignored Jesus' teachings during His earthly ministry because Paul discovered a new and different preaching than what Christ taught pre-resurrection. This rendered supposedly defunct that prior message of Jesus:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Bultmann...regards the <em><strong>historical Jesus as irrelevant</strong></em> as to the <em>kerygma</em> [<em>i.e.</em>, preaching]&nbsp;of the risen Lord whom Paul proclaimed. Bultmann understood 2 Corinthians 5:16 ("even though<em> we once knew Christ</em> <em>kata sarka </em>[through/by<em> means of the flesh</em>], <strong>we<em> know him thus no longer</em></strong>") to mean that <em><strong>Paul chose not to employ his knowledge of Jesus kerygmatically</strong></em> [<em>i.e.</em>, for preaching], a view with which Bultmann agreed [with Paul.]. Accordingly, the influential scholar of Marburg [<em>i.e.</em>, Bultmann] declared Paul the "founder of Christian theology." (Paul Barnett, <em>Paul: Missionary of Jesus</em> (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2008)&nbsp;at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://books.google.com/books?id=J7tnFxRTlbYC&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Bultmann%20Theology%20of%20Paul%20irrelevant%20jesus&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=Bultmann%20Theology%20of%20Paul%20irrelevant%20jesus&amp;f=false">13</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, Paul is viewed to instruct us no longer to teach Jesus' teachings while Jesus was in the flesh, i.e., from His earthly ministry (2 Cor. 5:16). But Jesus commanded to the contrary that we do so in Matthew 28:20. Hence, 2 Cor. 5:16 contradicts Matt. 28:20 as Paulinists construe 2 Cor. 5:16.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Paul Says <a id="eldersentitledtopay"></a>Elders Are Entitled To Pay for 'Preaching &amp; Teaching,' But Jesus Says No</strong></span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In 1 Tim. 5:17, Paul wrote: "The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching." Then Paul uses a verse from the Law of Moses about not muzzling an ox in an apostate replacemenf of its meaning to say churchgoers have a duty to pay the elders for their service. (1 Tim. 5:18.) See <a href="/web/20210303174615/https://jesuswordsonly.com/recommendedreading/855-outrageously-self-serving-rewrite-of-torah-in-1-corinthians-9-verses-9-to-10-.html">link</a>. Elsewhere, Paul says:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">14 In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel <em><strong>should receive their living from the gospel</strong></em>.&nbsp;(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+9%3A14&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 9:14 </a>NIV.)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">But I thought Jesus said to His disciples to lay no cost on anyone they served by preaching and healing? "Without cost you have received; <strong><em>without cost you are to give</em></strong>." (Matt. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/matthew/matthew10.htm" style="font-weight: bold;">10:8</a>, NAB.) Jesus in the prior verse was commanding the apostles to go out and preach the gospel, so the context makes quite clear that <em><strong>no charge or burden was to be made on auditors to hear preaching of the gospel or healing ministries</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, 1 Tim. 5:17-18 and 1 Cor. 9:14 contradicts Jesus in Matthew 10:8.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Incidentally compare: Micah 3:11 WEB which says similarly to what Jesus says:</span></p>

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 18pt;">Jesus <a id="thirteenth"></a>Teaches There Are Only 12 Apostles Into Eternity, But Paul Adds Himself To The List As a Thirteenth</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Matthias was voted to replace Judas in Acts 1, with the Lord Jesus deciding between two candidates, according to the prayer of the apostles over the casting of lots. Hence, the 12 were established long before Paul had his Damascus road experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">However, our Savior made the permanent tally of the Apostles established at exactly twelve --- for obvious reasons of historical symbolism. One can see the historical symmetry at Rev 21:12-14. Twelve apostles exist to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul was never&nbsp;numbered in that circle; not even Barnabas in his Epistle recognizes Paul&rsquo;s Apostleship: &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">However, Paul repetitiously claimed he was an apostle. Yet, not once did Jesus ever call Paul an apostle, even by Luke's quotations taken from Paul's claims to his encounter with Jesus. Read for yourself Paul's vision accounts in Acts chapers 9, 22 and 26<strong>. In these three accounts, the Jesus whom Paul met said Paul would be a <em>martus</em>. </strong>That means "<strong>witness</strong>," not "apostolos" (messenger). </span></p>

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Paul <a id="celibacy"></a>Exhorts and Commands Celibacy, But Jesus Clearly Says It is A Choice Not Within Everyone's Power</strong></span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul taught against being married. He wrote in 1 Cor. 10:27-28:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">"Are you bound to a wife? &nbsp;Do not seek to be free. &nbsp;Are you <em>free from a wife</em>? <strong> Do </strong><em><strong>not seek marriage</strong></em>. &nbsp;But if you marry, you do not sin, and if a girl marries she does not sin."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In line with this Paul also wrote:</span></p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">"I wish all were as I am," meaning unmarried. (1 Cor. 7:7.)</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">To help prevent the desire to be married, Paul said: &lsquo;It is good that a man should not touch a woman.&rsquo; (1 Cor. 7:1.)</span><br/> <br/><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"> If Paul is a true prophet and wishes something, such as avoiding touching a woman and to not "seek to be married," then Paul clearly endorses celibacy for us too as a superior way of life.</span><br/><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">However, Jesus speaks differently of celibacy as something for some but not all disciples. It is not a command or even an exhortation. It is merely a legitimate option. "He who is able to receive this, let him receive it." Matt. 19:12.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The contradiction arises because Jesus never says or implies "do not seek marriage." Significantly, Jesus never applies any moral suasion or pressure to be celibate, while Paul clearly does so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Jesus said there is One Pastor and One Teacher:</span></p>

<p class="p3" style="font-weight: bold; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">"Nor are you to be called '<em>teacher</em>', for you have one <em>Teacher&nbsp;</em>(kathegetes - synonym for didaskolos), the Christ."

[See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://biblehub.com/text/matthew/23-10.htm">Greek tab at Biblehub</a>, translating kathegetes as "instructor."]&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="font-weight: bold;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, Jesus says there is "one...didaskalos" in Matt 23:8. He underscores two verses later the same point by using a synonym, insisting there is "one teacher" - kathegetes. And Jesus says in John 10:16, there is "one pastor" -- using the Greek word poimen. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p3" style="font-weight: bold;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">But what does Paul claim is true, using the identical Greek words?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul in contradiction of Christ says: "And his gifts were that some should be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, <em><strong>some pastors</strong> </em>(shepherds, Greek <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>poimenas</em></span></strong>) and <em><strong>teachers </strong></em><strong>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">didaskolos</span>)</strong>...." (Eph. 4:11.) Paul also describes himself as a "teacher" (didaskalos) to the Gentiles. (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://biblehub.com/text/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Tim. 1:11</a> -Bible Hub Greek tab.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul thus directly violates Jesus' literal words in Matt 23:8 and John 10:16.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>ADVISORY NOTE</strong>: Some sources deflect this literal contradiction between Jesus in Matt 23:8 and Paul's 2 Tim. 1:11 claim to be a "teacher" in two ways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">First, they do so by changing Matt 23:8 from "didaskalos" to "kathegetes." See BlueBible's concordance at this <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/23/1/t_conc_952008">link</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Second, they then solely translate "kathegetes" as "Master," not as "teacher" or "instructor" even though the latter is Biblehub's sole translation of "kathegetes." See this <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://www.eternalgod.org/q-a-6062/">link</a> (article claiming no contradiction between Paul and Jesus here once we acccept "kathegetes" is supposedly in Matt 23:8, and it allegedly means "Master"). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">What is the truth? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">First, if one goes to BibleHub's "Greek parallels" tab, it shows you the major Greek text sources word for word. In six text traditions, we have "didaskalos" while three sources have "kathegetes" in Matt 23:8. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://biblehub.com/texts/matthew/23-8.htm">link.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Now before looking at what source tradition is more authoritative, let's look at Jesus' context for Matt 23:8. Jesus is saying "do not call yourself a Rabbi." (Matt 23:7.) This was not saying do not call yourself a master, but instead don't call yourself a teacher of religious doctrines. Jesus simply chose a different word to emphasize this in the very next sentence of Matt 23:8. Do not call yourself a "DIDASKALOS" -- a teacher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"> Hence, if "kathegetes" truly means "master" as the proponents of the three texts which use "kathegetes" prefer (to avoid Paul literally contradicting Jesus), it would not make sense. Jesus is explaining by repetition why you should not call yourself a "Rabbi" by using a word synonym. That word is perfectly DIDASKALOS. Hence, just by reading the context, and allowing the argument that kathegetes means "master," we find the six texts that say "DIDASKALOS" fits Jesus' meaning clearly, while the three that have "kathegetes" in 23:8 (if it means "master") do not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Also, why would Jesus use "kathegetes" not only in 23:10 twice, but a third time in 23:8? For simple literary reasons he would be intending related concepts to put emphasis on the point. But repeating the same word three times in one context would appear to be over exaggeration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Next, let's find out what is regarded by evangelical experts as the most authoritative original Greek. W.E. <strong>Vine - <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Edwy_Vine">an evangelical scholar</a> -- in his famous and well-respected New Testament Word Pictures</strong>&nbsp;(Thomas Nelson: 2015) says at page <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://books.google.com/books?id=uPD3CQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;ots=pTyVOtcSAW&amp;dq=matthew%2023%3A8%20kathegetes%20or%20didaskalos&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage&amp;q=matthew%2023:8%20kathegetes%20or%20didaskalos&amp;f=false">198:</a>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Rabbi....Matthew 23:7, 8 ... <strong>kathegetes</strong>....some manuscripts have it in <strong>verse 8, but the most authentitic have didaskalos</strong>; this is rendered as teacher by Christ of Himself; ... of Nicodemus in Israel [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://biblehub.com/text/john/3-10.htm">Jn] 3:10 didaskalos</a>].... </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Finally, what does kathegetes truly mean? While it can mean "master," it also means "teacher." Vine says this on page 198 as well. Hence, because a Rabbi was a teacher, not a master, and because Jesus said in verses 7 and 8 do not call yourself a Rabbi, or Didaskalos (teacher), Jesus obviously chose to underscore this by use of a synonymn -- kathegetes -- meaning teacher -- in verse 10. He did not use "kathegetes" to mean "master" -- among its various meanings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, in context, it is clear that Jesus intends a meaning in Matt 23:8 (didaskalos) and 23:10 (kathegetes) which Paul's words literally and substantively contradict. In fact, in violation of Jesus' commands, Paul calls himself a "Teacher" (didaskalos) in 2 Tim. 1:11. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Whether 23:8 is didaskalos or kathegetes does not change the fact of a contradiction. When didaskalos is recognized in 23:8, the contradiction is literal. If we thought kathegetes in 23:8 besides 23:10 were truly more valid (uninfluenced by a desire to protect Paul), it is still a substantive contradiction. Kathegetes in context means teacher in Matt 23:10, and hence would have the same meaning if it were also present in 23:8. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">However, based upon Vine's analysis of what is the most authoritative text of 23:8, we know the contradiction is literal. For Paul says he is a "didaskalos" in an epistle addressed to Christians. By contrast, Jesus said in Matt 23:8 not to call yourself a "didaskalos" among Christians for only one is our "didaskalos" -- Jesus Himself.&nbsp; Paul clearly violated this command of Christ!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Finally, none of this explains why Paul says there are many "pastors" in the church, when Jesus said he is our "sole pastor" in John 10:16. Of course, this contradictions is disguised too by the standard translations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"> First, Jesus says "I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, andthey will hear my voice; and they will become one flock with <strong>one shepherd</strong> (POIMEN)." When Paul contradicts this literally in Greek in Ephesians 4:11, saying there are many POIMEN in the church, the POIMEN is translated as "pastors" -- inconsistent with how the same root word was translated as "shepherd" when Jesus used the singular form. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">What is the effect on you the reader? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The literal contradiction by Paul of Jesus does not jump off the page as it would to one reading the Greek. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Can translators varying the translation of the same root Greek word make sense for any legitimate other purpose than concealing Paul contradicts Jesus? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">No. For there is no justification because Jesus and Paul are talking about the same thing: leadership in the church. Jesus claims exclusivity but Paul claims that is not true. Translators impede both Jesus and Paul being heard speaking on the same topic with the same language so the opposition of those expressions could come to the reader's mind. Jesus' flock needs to know Paul is using the Master's own identical language to convey an opposing view.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">This is nothing new. In our article <a href="/web/20210303174615/https://jesuswordsonly.com/recommendedreading/429-mistranslations-to-help-paul.html" style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 24px;">Mistranslations to Help Paul</a>, we review multiple clear-cut examples where passages in the Hebrew or Christian Bible are mistranslated with the obvious purpose of protecting Paul. In some cases entire sentences are baselessly added from thin air with no other explanation other than to protect Paul from embarassment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Incidentally, the reason Jesus says He will be "sole shepherd" or "sole pastor" is because Jesus is alluding to the prophecy of the David-heir-as-Messiah in a new covenant in Ezekiel 37:24. There the NIV has it that the Davidic king "will be king over them, and they will have <strong>one shepherd</strong>," and "they will follow my laws and be careful to keep my decrees," and "I <strong>will make a covenant</strong> of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant." Thus, one can see Paul contradicts not only Jesus but also the Law &amp; the Prophets: (a) by Paul claiming Jesus must confront competitor shepherds caused by Paul's outreach; and (b) that God's laws will be denigrated as no longer applicable and need no longer be followed, as long as we simply have "faith" that Jesus died for our sins and rose from the dead (1 Cor. 15:1-4.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor.+5%3A9-13&amp;version=NKJV">1 Cor. 5:9-13</a>, Paul clearly writes:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: 5:10 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. 5:11 But now I have written unto<em> <strong>you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner</strong>; with<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> such an one no not to eat</strong></span></em><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span> 5:12 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? 5:13 But them that are without God judgeth.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">What did Pharisees like Paul say was Jesus' sin or error?<strong><em> Eating with sinners.</em></strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?&amp;search=Luke+15">Luke 15:1</a>, the Pharisees accused Jesus of error, saying: "This man receives sinners and <strong><em>eats with them</em></strong>." Then Jesus defends this practice in a Parable of the Lost Sheep -- that if you have a lost sheep, you don't wait for it to come home, but you go out to where you can find it, and then lead it back home. Jesus defends proactively socializing with sinners so as to bring them home as lost sheep, which included eating with sinners:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In another context, Jesus gives a similar defense when the Pharisees similarly accused Jesus of the alleged error of eating and socializing with sinners:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">5&nbsp;</span>While Jesus was having dinner at Levi&rsquo;s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">16&nbsp;</span>When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span>&nbsp;saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: &ldquo;<strong><em>Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners</em></strong>?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">17&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">On hearing this, Jesus said to them,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">&ldquo;It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.&rdquo; (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+2%3A15-17&amp;version=NIV">Mark 2:15-17</a> NIV. See also&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+9%3A10-12&amp;version=NIV">Matt 9:10-12</a>&nbsp;(same).)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Jesus defended the practice of making an effort to socialize with sinners to bring them back from a lost condition to a saved one. For the "healthy" don't need a doctor to call upon them -- only the sick (sinners in context).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">But Paul says the opposite. Don't "eat" with sinners, Paul clearly says. Hence, 1 Cor. 5:9 contradicts Jesus's clear practice of eating with sinners. This is akin to Paul's idea of "turning" people over to Satan, abandoning them and praying Satan takes control of their lives. Jesus says this is an error -- Jesus instead says you seek to turn such people from Satan and back to God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The only argument that Jesus supposedly agrees with Paul comes from Jesus' direction that within the church, we were to confront brothers / sisters with sins against us, and only after this process is taken in two unsuccessful steps, then you should treat the sinner as a tax collector / sinner. See Matt. 18. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Yet, this does not mean not eating with them, as Jesus made a point to eat with tax collectors and sinners as representative of "my sheep who are lost" and need "repentance." Jesus included them as if they were his sheep previously -- implicitly saved sheep at one point -- but are now lost. The good shepherd exclaims when he comes home "I have found <em><strong>MY sheep</strong> </em>who was lost." (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+15:1-7">Luke 15:6</a>.) These are "sinners who repent" in distinction from "righteous sheep" who need no repentance. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+15:1-7">Luke 15:7</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Treating someone as a tax collector thus meant treating them differently but did not mean to not eat with them. This likely meant not to give them the special greeting of shalom (God's peace) or visiting them in their home. Why do I suggest that? Because John speaks in his epistle that we should not take certain heretics into our home or give them such a greeting. Jesus' instructions to treat someone as a "sinner" thus does not necessarily mean not eating with them. In light of Jesus' practice of eating with sinners who were part of "my sheep" previously, we should not construe it to prohibit eating with sinning Christians as a means of bringing back a "lost sheep" that once were obedient followers of Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Paul <a id="eternallysecure"></a>Teaches We Are Eternally Secure, But Jesus Teaches Insecurity to a Sinning Believer</strong></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: medium; color: #000000; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Another important example is that most evangelicals believe Paul teaches we are eternally secure if we simply believe one time (Romans 8:1; 10:9; Eph. 2:8-9.) Calvinists similarly say salvation can never be lost due to predestination. (Phil. 1:6; Eph. 1:5,13-14; 2 Tim. 1:12; Rom. 8:29.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Body-after-header" style="text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: medium; color: #000000; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Times; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span>However, Jesus is repeatedly warning Christians to feel insecure about their salvation when sinning. All the &lsquo;weeping and gnashing&rsquo; parables fit in this category. All the non-parabolic statements about hell fire for misbehavior by &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; fit in the same category. &ldquo;Every tree that lacks good fruit is cut down and thrown in the fire.&rdquo; (Mat.7:19.) &ldquo;Anyone who says &lsquo;Fool&rsquo; is in danger of hell-fire&rdquo; (Matt. 5:22), etc. Indeed, Paul&rsquo;s teachings above directly undermine the Lord&rsquo;s most extreme hyperbole -- repeated three different times. Jesus addresses the apostles as &ldquo;you&rdquo;--and says &ldquo;you&rdquo; (including "believers in me") have a choice: you can go to hell whole or heaven maimed. Jesus then explains that entry into heaven is dependent on you bravely cutting off body-parts ensnaring you in sin. (Mark 9:42-47; Matt.5:29-30; 18:6-9.) Jesus means to cut off the temptation and lust for fleshly sins causing "you" -- the apostles in context -- to sin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p class="Body-after-header" style="text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: medium; color: #000000; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Times; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Thus, Paul&rsquo;s message of eternal security in these passages and your inability to fail to reach heaven negates the purpose behind every warning that Jesus gives. Paul thereby directly undermines Jesus&rsquo; effort to implore the most urgent need to engage in salvation-restoring repentance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: medium; color: #000000; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">When Jesus uses the term &ldquo;justified,&rdquo; Jesus links it to repentance from sin. The publican who repents from sin in deep regret goes home &ldquo;justified.&rdquo; The Pharisee who does not do so and thinks he has nothing ever to regret, goes home unjustified. (Luke 18:14.)<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Body-after-header" style="text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: medium; color: #000000; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Times; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">What does Paul teach instead? Paul says you are &ldquo;justified by faith apart from the works of the Law.&rdquo; (Rom. 4:2.) "But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that <em><strong>justifies the ungodly</strong></em>, his faith is counted for righteousness." (Romans 4:5, KJV.) Once that happens, we have &ldquo;peace with God.&rdquo; (Rom. 5:1.) Once &lsquo;justified&rsquo; in that manner, &ldquo;we shall be saved from the wrath [of God] through him.&rdquo; (Rom. 5:9.) Paul teaches a manner never to have regret again -- by the mere step of believing -- and you are justified while yet ungodly, i.e., unrepentant from sin. At least, this is how the young Luther and most construe Paul's meaning in Romans 4:5.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Who Should We Follow/Imitate? Paul? or Jesus?</span></strong></span></h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Peter tells us to imitate Christ. The author of Hebrews (Barnabas) likewise says Jesus is our example. But Paul says we are to imitate and follow himself. I am quoting here from "Church Myths -- Church of Christ or Paul" by an anonymous author:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In church do the sheep learn all about Jesus and what He instructs? Not as a rule. They are taught the gospel of Paul and not the gospel of Jesus. Well you may ask what is the difference. Well the main difference is that Jesus was ... proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom. Jesus was to be our perfect example on how to live, yet Paul in his letters tells us how to live. Jesus told us to follow Him alone, yet Paul says <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+4:16">1Co 4:16</a> "Wherefore I beseech (beg) you, <strong><em>be ye followers of m</em></strong><strong><em>e</em></strong>." ...&nbsp;It is the Pope of Rome that instructs "his" church to be followers and imitators of himself.

Here is a few quick example. Jesus instructs us to feed the poor. Paul says, "For even when we were with you we gave you orders, saying, <em><strong>If any man does no work, let him not have food</strong></em>. For it has come to our ears that there are some among you whose behavior is uncontrolled, who do no work at all, but <strong><em>are over-interested in the business of others</em></strong>."2Th 3:10 Jesus said to feed the poor. He did not say feed the poor unless they are over interested in other people's business. This is what Paul does. He pontificates endless rules of conduct, yet from the other side of his mouth he says we are free in Christ?&nbsp;(Church Myths - Church of Christ or Paul?

<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Paul <a id="Pauldeniesobedience"></a>Denies Obedience Grants Any Righteousness Unto Life, But Jesus Says It Does</span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul says that&nbsp;"<em>if there HAD been a law given which&nbsp;<strong>could have</strong> given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law." (</em>Gal 3:21). This tells me that Paul believed that no such Law ever existed that could give eternal life. This is in direct contradiction with Jesus; "If you want to enter life, obey the commandments." (Mat 19:17) &nbsp;[Contributed by David B. 12/3/2011]. It also violates Exodus <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://books.google.com.pr/books?id=UctMAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=Jason%20Van%20Vliet%2C%20Ed.%2C%20Living%20Waters%20from%20Ancient%20Springs%3A%20Essays%20in%20Honor%20of%20Cornelis%20Van%20Dam&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q=Jason%20Van%20Vliet,%20Ed.,%20Living%20Waters%20from%20Ancient%20Springs:%20Essays%20in%20Honor%20of%20Cornelis%20Van%20Dam&amp;f=false">20:6</a> within Ten Commandments where Yahweh-God says He extends "mercy to those who love me and obey my commandments."</span></p>

Thus:</strong></span><br/><br/><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Mt 5:17 - Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Mt 7:12 - Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">And the Lord added that, beyond or on top of the life that the law gives, he offers perfection to those who would follow him. Thus:</span><br/><br/><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Mt 19:16 - And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? 17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. 18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, 19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? 21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>In summary, Paul&rsquo;s gospel says:</strong> Never mind the law; just believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you are saved. Thus many believers disregard the Ten Commandments without feeling guilty, believing that they have been saved by faith in Christ, and that once saved, always saved. But if they cannot enter life, how can they go to perfection?</span><br/><br/><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>But the Lord&rsquo;s gospel says:</strong> Obey the law and enter life, then achieve perfection by following him. Faith in him makes easier entry to life and achievement of perfection, because the Holy Spirit puts and writes the law in our minds and hearts. But the Holy Spirit does not dwell in unclean vessels. The correct sequence therefore is: Repent, forgive, believe in Christ, be baptized, and the Holy Spirit will indwell us and lead us to life (by obeying the Law) and perfection (by following Christ in agape love).</span><br/><br/><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul quoted from Psalm 14 and used a tiny truncated phrase to make a huge generalization to set aside the Law. Fully read, Psalm 14 clearly states that while none is righteous among the fools and children of iniquity, God always has a righteous generation who keep the Law.

<p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus <a id="blasphemy"></a>Says The Law Cannot Justify A Blasphemer But Paul Says It Can</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus speaks of the unpardonable sin of blaspheming (insulting God) which is the only sin God says the violator "will not be held guiltless." (Exodus 20:7). This was a sin that could thus never be justified under the Law given Moses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">However, Paul says by faith in Christ we are "justified of all things <strong><em>one could not be justified under the Law of Moses</em></strong>." <strong style="color: #494a44; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 24px;">&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+13%3A39&amp;version=KJV" style="color: #517291; outline: none; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 24px;">Acts 13:39</a>.&nbsp;Paul's words on this change in principles necessarily only can apply as a change to the consequences of blasphemy in Exodus 20:7. There is no doubt on Paul's view.&nbsp;Paul cites himself as an example of a blasphemer who received "mercy."&nbsp;(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm" style="color: #517291; text-decoration: underline; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;">1 Tim 1:13 NIV</a>.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">So we have a flat contradiction: Paul says the sin one could never be justified / forgiven under the Law given Moses can now be pardoned while Jesus, referring to the same sin, said it was unpardonable. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus Four Times Teaches Grace (Charis) Is By Exceeding Lukewarm Works That Sinners Find Easy to Do</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Jesus in Luke four times uses the word Grace. But you would never know this based upon modern mistranslations of this word as "benefit," "credit," etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Why? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Because otherwise you would see the clear contradiction between Paul and Jesus. Just as Jesus taught that lukewarm works by a Christian will cause Jesus to spew you out of his mouth, Jesus in Luke says that we must exceed what sinners would do as good works, such as doing only good to those who love you; lending to only those who can repay, etc. instead, Jesus wanted exceptional works that have a higher aim than doing the minimal, but instead to go higher (be "hot" in Rev. 3:16) to please God. Paul teaches the opposite -- that doing such works risks boasting. Thus, Paul set the standard of receiving God's grace (God's favor) so it never can be based upon any degree of works at all. Please see <a href="/web/20210303174615/https://jesuswordsonly.com/recommendedreading/697-grace-or-favor-in-the-bible.html">Grace and Favor in the Bible.</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus showed Thomas his nail holes. Jesus had flesh before He ascended. Jesus the Man inherited life eternal, and gave us the right by obeying him to become "sons of God" too, with the same privilege of resurrection. Jesus promised those who keep listening / following that He will resurrect our bodies on the last day -- while our spirits go immediately to heaven upon death. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">However, Paul says our souls sleep, and a body that goes to heaven is one that is "changed," and no longer "flesh." Paul says -- contrary to Jesus' own experience where Jesus in the flesh inherited heaven and ascended there -- that "flesh" cannot inherit eternal life. Paul's view of our death and resurrection is totally at odds with the view of Jesus.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul in 1 Tim. 5:18 makes a similar paraphrase of Deuteronomy that &nbsp;Jesus made -- a "worker is worthy of his wage." Paul then applies it opposite from how Jesus applied the passage. &nbsp;For in Matthew 10:10, Jesus is telling the apostles that they may not ask for money from those to whom they preach or teach. However, they could support themselves under the &nbsp;Law of hospitality, where you could be hosted in a worthy person&rsquo;s home, and do chores of the household, and get room and board, and if you did more than your share, you could receive a wage from the host-family. Jesus then said the &ldquo;worker is worthy of his wage,&rdquo; intending obviously to refer to a non-preaching non-teaching compensation as a boarder which the Law sanctioned. However, Paul applied this same verse - "a worker is worthy of his wage" -- directly to prove the duty of congregants to pay Paul for preaching and teaching them.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">But Paul says:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on <em><strong>him that justifieth the ungodly</strong></em>, his faith is counted for righteousness." (Romans&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:4-5&amp;version=KJV">4:5</a>, KJV.)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">(Paul in context is relying upon a mistranslation of Genesis 15:6 from 257 BC in the Septuagint Greek translation. <a href="/web/20210303174615/https://jesuswordsonly.com/recommendedreading/169-chapter-26-7jwo-genesis-156.html">Link</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In context, all mainstream scholars concur Paul means God justified Abraham before Abraham repented of unrighteousness. Unlike Exodus and Proverbs quoted above, Paul in Romans 4:3-6 intends us to understand that by faith alone, <em>i.e.</em>, believing God, as did Abraham which was that he would have a child through Sarah in his old age [Gen. 15:5-6], while we are ungodly, we are supposedly justified. This is why all mainstream scholars say Paul taught justification <strong><em>without repentance from sin</em></strong>, but based upon faith alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">However, in Ezekiel we learn that only upon repentance including turning from evil did the ungodly become godly again and receive life (<em>i.e.</em>, eternal life) and hence were justified.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><sup>14</sup>Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if<em><strong> he turn from his sin</strong></em>, and <strong><em>do that which is lawful and right</em></strong>;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><sup>15</sup>If the <strong><em>wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live</em></strong>, he shall not die.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><sup>16</sup>None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live. (Ezekiel <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel%2033:14-16&amp;version=KJV">33:14-16</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Likewise, Jesus teaches justification is solely by repentance from sin in the Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican. The one who went home "justified" is the one who beat his breast and asked God to be "merciful to me, a sinner," but the Pharisee (who <em><strong>believed</strong> </em>in Yahweh) was smug that he had not sinned and went home unjustified. See Luke&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2018:9-14&amp;version=KJV">18:9-14</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">While in prison, Paul met a runaway slave, Onesimus, the property of a Christian -- presumably <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philemon+1&amp;version=YLT">Philemon</a>. Paul sent the slave back to his owner. This action is forbidden in Deuteronomy 23:15-16:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">"Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee."</span></strong></span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Rather than give the slave sanctuary, Paul returned him to his owner. Paul seems to hint that he would like Philemon to give Onesimus his freedom, but does not actually request it. He asks &ldquo;receive him as me&rdquo; and if Onesimus did Philemon any harm, bill Paul the damages. But Paul never directly asks for Philemon&rsquo;s freedom although Paul defenders read it into these statements. Most likely Paul is saying don&rsquo;t retaliate against Onesimus for running away, and treat him as a brother and no more as just a servant but &ldquo;more than a servant,&rdquo; yet without asking him to give Onesimus his freedom.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul in the same passage that he says Jesus is a created being -- "the first-born of creation" -- says Jesus is an "image of God." (Col. 2:15.) This is a violation of the first commandment which prohibits using a creature (as Paul viewed Jesus) as an image of God. See our <a href="/web/20210303174615/https://jesuswordsonly.com/recommendedreading/322-paul-claims-jesus-is-the-image-of-god.html"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">webpage article</span></a>. This also contradicts Paul's own condemnation of those who exchange God for the "image of corruptible man" in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+1%3A23&amp;version=KJV">Romans 1:23</a>: "And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man...." &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">How can one reconcile these statements? Even though Jesus was sinless, he did come in human flesh (sarx in Greek). Apostle John even says that anyone denying Jesus came in human flesh is the Anti-Christ. &nbsp;See 2 John 1:17. So Jesus came in corruptible flesh, but Jesus resisted temptation, even as the epistle writer of Hebrews says: Jesus was tempted in all ways as we are but did not sin. The only way Paul can justify Col 2:15 and Romans 1:23 is that Jesus did not come in corruptible flesh, and thus can be "an image of God" but if Jesus came in corruptible flesh, Jesus could not lawfully be the image of God. Then it logically follows that Paul believed Jesus did not come in corruptible flesh - Paul must believe Jesus did not have true human flesh. OK, Paul if you say so. But that leaves only one conclusion: you must be teaching Jesus did not come in human flesh. What did Apostle John say in 2 John 1:17? Then who was the Jesus whom Paul met outside Damascus?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul in 2 Timothy 2:18 condemns heretics who claim "The resurrection has already taken place."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">One commentator points out the heretics had reasonable support in the words of Paul for the very same thing which Paul condemns in 2 Tim. 2:18:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Concerning the resurrection, Paul&rsquo;s baptismal theology might be&nbsp;seen to imply that<em><strong> the believer has risen with Christ in baptism</strong></em> (Rom. 6; Col. 2). Concerning the&nbsp;body, Paul had said that <strong><em>flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God</em></strong> (1 Cor.15:50). In&nbsp;other words:<strong> could not the heretics attacked in the Pastorals claim Paul&rsquo;s support for their&nbsp;doctrines?</strong> There is, in fact, a distinct possibility that they did so. (Oskar Skarsaune, &ldquo;Heresy and the Pastoral Epistles,&rdquo; <em>Themelios</em> 20.1 (October 1994): 9-14, at 10 available in PDF at this <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/heresy_skarsaune.pdf">link</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Skarsaune cites in support several scholars who construct the arguments of condemned groups who relied upon Paul's words for this very doctrine that the resurrection of Christians already has happened:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul was willing to appear that he and his closest followers were outwardly righteous but inwardly Paul did not believe in the necessity of any external action performed to appear righteous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">For example, as to Timothy&rsquo;s circumcision, Luke records:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">&ldquo;Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him.&rdquo; (Acts16:3)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">But elsewhere Paul says: &ldquo;I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision,<strong><em> <em><strong>Christ will be of no advantage to you</strong></em></em></strong>. I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that<strong><em> he is obligated to keep the whole Law</em></strong>&rdquo; (Gal5:2).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">So was Timothy now obligated to keep the whole Law? Or did Timothy and Paul participate in a hypocritical show of obedience to the Law just like the Pharisees whom Jesus condemned for exactly the same behavior?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">We see Paul's willingness to mold himself to whomever he wishes to win over rather than have a non-hypocritical integrity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Listen to this next quote. As you do, keep in mind what Jesus said about Pharisees like Paul who wash the outside of the cup but inwardly do not have the heart that follows their actions -- they are hypocrites.&nbsp;Paul says he is &lsquo;all things to all men&rsquo; in this passage:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">&ldquo;To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. <strong><em>To those under the law I<strong><em> became as one under the law</em></strong> (though&nbsp;<strong><em>not being myself under the law</em></strong>)</em></strong> that I&nbsp;<strong>might win those under the law</strong>. To those outside the law<strong><em> I became as one outside the law</em></strong> (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that&nbsp;<strong><em>I might win those outside the law</em></strong>. To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have<em><strong> become all things to all men, that I might save some</strong></em>.&rdquo; 1Cor9:20+.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">With this hypocritical strategy, Jesus said the Pharisees could not save anyone,&nbsp;<em><em>i.e.</em>,</em> could not lead anyone to God. Instead, Jesus said their followers would become twice the sons of hell (Matt.&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303174615/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23:1-15&amp;version=NIV">23:15</a>) as the hypocritical teachers who taught like Paul explicitly does.</span></p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">A Real Life Example of Pauline Use of This Admitted Contradiction</span><strong> - 2015</strong>.</span></h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">A core-leader of a church in Southern California recently came to our small group meeting and used this contradiction as proof that the church is free NOT to help a poor person financially in a health emergency. </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">We were struggling with whether it was right or wrong to help with a health-related emergency of an AIDS victim. She had been in and out of hospitals all week, collapsing at home, and was rushed to the hospital by people responding to her phone requests to take her to the hospital. &nbsp;</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">But now after returning home, &nbsp;she realized that due to her many visits to the hospital that she had lost track that her cell minutes needed recharging. Her minutes would expire on a Friday night. Without an emergency replenishment -- and she had no money or way to travel to get the replenishment -- she would be home alone over a weekend with no way to call for help if she collapsed again. </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">So my wife paid her phone minutes to cover the weekend and more. This led to the head of the HIV-AIDS ministry of the church to come to meet with our small group to review the "rules" of care-giving for AIDS victims. This leader<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> actually cited the contradiction in Paul's words above as proof that sometimes it is right to help and sometimes wrong to help the poor.</span></strong> </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">She quoted Paul: "<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #ff0000;">We are to bear our own burden</span>" and "<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #ff0000;">We are to bear each other's burdens</span>." Then the HIV-AIDS appointed leader said, "<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">that is a contradiction, isn't it</span></span><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">?</span></strong></span>" My wife and I exchanged knowing glances of disbelief. Then the AIDS ministry head concluded that this means we have to sometimes make a hard choice not to bear another's burden, and force them to bear it alone.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">But what about a health emergency? To this, we were instructed that there is no exception to the care-giving rules -- no personal money can be spent to help even with a health emergency without first calling the head of the HIV-AIDS ministry (this very nice lady) for permission. Whether this is right or wrong is not the point. Rather, <strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">the point is that <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Pauline thinking</span> allows one to rely upon <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul's recognized self-contradictions</span> so we get to pick and choose which side of a contradiction we will follow.</span></strong></span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This example proves that Paul's self-contradictions have real-world impact upon the health and safety of this AIDS victim, as well as likely of many others.&nbsp;What degradation has the church of Christ fallen when Jesus' commands to feed, clothe, and heal the sick are relaxed by such nonsense found in Paul's own writings.&nbsp;</span></h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">6. Paul Contradicts Damascus' Jesus or Disobeys Him</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul in Acts 22 tells Festus that the Road-to-Damascus Jesus appeared in a trance after the Road-to-Damascus appearance. The Road-to-Damascus Jesus tells Paul while Paul is in prayer in the Temple to leave Jerusalem without seeing the 12 apostles because "Jesus" was sending him to the Gentiles. This is just 2 weeks after the Road-to-Damascus experience that turned Paul around. Did the Road-to-Damascus Jesus truly say that?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="color: #232323;">No. Or Paul was disobedient to Jesus' direction.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="color: #232323;">For Paul cannot claim he went exclusively to the Gentiles when he only switched much later to preach only to Gentiles because Jews rejected him: </span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="color: #232323;">&ldquo;When the Jewish people saw the crowds, they were very jealous. They insulted Paul and spoke against everything he said. But Paul and Barnabas bravely said: We had to tell God&rsquo;s message to you <strong>before we told it to anyone else</strong>. But you rejected the message! This proves that you don&rsquo;t deserve eternal life. <strong>Now we are going to the Gentiles</strong>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic; color: red;">(Acts 13:45-46).</span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">7. "Do not Curse" but "I Curse so-and-so."</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul tells us in Romans 12:14 "do not curse your enemies." But Paul says "cursed" is anyone who does not love the Lord. (1 Cor. 16:22.)&nbsp; Paul also says&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"accursed" is anyone who preaches a different Gospel than was "received." (Gal. 1:8-9.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">While Paul may say <a href="/web/20210303174615/https://jesuswordsonly.com/recommendedreading/486-positives-about-paul.html">some things worthy of praise</a>, Paul is fraught with contradictions of Jesus, the Original Testament, and with his own self!

However, my correspondent was assuming Westcott had such Greek, but Bible Hub which shows the Westcott Hort text proves this was not true. Instead the NIV and all the translations listed above improperly added something - "I became<em><strong> your father</strong></em>...." It truly was "I have begotten thee...."</span></p>

Hence, this is not a true contradiction between Jesus and Paul. </span></p>

Even though he was assuming incorrectly that it was due to a competing variant in the Westcott Hort Greek compilation, it still opened up the issue which proves the "father" in 1 Cor. 4:15 was simply an excessively loose translation.</span></p>

Jesus makes this subtle point in a parable about one in hell who called out to "Father Abraham" in a prayer rather than to God Himself.
