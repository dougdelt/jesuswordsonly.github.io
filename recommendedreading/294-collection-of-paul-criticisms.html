<h1>Collection of Paul Criticisms at St. Lawrence University Blog</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=145112012214260&amp;set=p.145112012214260" class="hyperlink" rel="nofollow">Did you ever ask the question...</a> <a href="http://www.areapal.com/social/how/St.%20Lawrence%20University">St. Lawrence University Blog</a></span><br /><span class="caption" style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">--------------------------It is not a new/modern concept to question Paul.------------------------ **********From Tertullian to President Jefferson********** This is a chronological collection of quotes and examination of Paul throughout history:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The entire Book of <strong>James </strong>is a rebuttal to Paul &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"<strong>Justin</strong> [103-65 A.D.] took no notice of Paul...." (Encyclopedia Biblica.)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Papias</strong> (a disciple of Apostle John) from 130 A.D. too never once quotes Paul.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Tertullian</strong>, 207 A.D. - A Highly Critical Analysis In fact, Tertullian in Adversus Marcion at <a href="http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/1003/1001/0160-0220,_Tertullianus,_Adversus_Marcionem,_MLT.html#[0327A]">3:5</a> (Caput V) (others erroneously cite 3:6:4) said Paul is the "apostle of the heretics." In Latin, he called Paul "haereticorum apostolus." One commentator says this meant "the writings of Paul --- the haereticorum apostolos of Tertullian --- were regarded suspiciously at Rome." (Hans Lietzmann, The Lord's Supper (Brill: 1979)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In 207 A.D., <strong>Tertullian</strong> in <em>Against Marcion</em>…made the following sobering points about Paul: • Jesus never made Paul an apostle from the records that we can read. • Paul's claim to apostleship solely relies upon Paul's veracity. • If Paul were a true apostle, he is still an inferior apostle because Paul in Acts 15 submitted his doctrine to the twelve. • If Paul later varied from the twelve, we must regard the twelve as more authoritative than Paul because Paul came later. • Paul's claim of being selected as an apostle later by Jesus seems implausible. That story asks us to believe Jesus had not planned things adequately with the twelve.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">• Lastly, <strong>Tertullian</strong> said Jesus warned us of false prophets who would come doing miracles in His name and signs and wonders, and Paul perfectly matches that prophesied type of prophet.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The key quote with most of these points is the following passage from <strong>Tertullian</strong> -- written in 207 A.D. in <em>Against Marcion</em>:&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li>I desire to hear from Marcion the origin of Paul the apostle. I am a sort of new disciple, having had instruction from no other teacher. For the moment my only belief is that nothing ought to be believed without good reason, and that is believed without good reason which is believed without knowledge of its origin: and I must with the best of reasons approach this inquiry with uneasiness when I find one affirmed to be an apostle, of whom in the list of the apostles in the gospel I find no trace. So when I am told that he [i.e., Paul] was subsequently promoted by our Lord, by now at rest in heaven, I find some lack of foresight in the fact that Christ did not know beforehand that he would have need of him, but after setting in order the office of apostleship and sending them out upon their duties, considered it necessary, on an impulse and not by deliberation, to add another, by compulsion so to speak and not by design [i.e., on the Road to Damascus]. So then, shipmaster out of Pontus [i.e., Marcion], supposing you have never accepted into your craft any smuggled or illicit merchandise, have never appropriated or adulterated any cargo, and in the things of God are even more careful and trustworthy, will you please tell us under what bill of lading you accepted Paul as apostle, who had stamped him with that mark of distinction, who commended him to you, and who put him in your charge? Only so may you with confidence disembark him [i.e., Paul]: only so can he avoid being proved to belong to him who has put in evidence all the documents that attest his apostleship. He [i.e., Paul] himself, says Marcion, claims to be an apostle, and that not from men nor through any man, but through Jesus Christ. Clearly any man can make claims for himself: but his claim is confirmed by another person’s attestation. One person writes the document, another signs it, a third attests the signature, and a fourth enters it in the records. No man is for himself both claimant and witness. Besides this, you have found it written that many will come and say, I am Christ. If there is one that makes a false claim to be Christ, much more can there be one who professes that he is an apostle of Christ.... [L]et the apostle, belong to your other god:.... (Tertullian, Against Marcion (Oxford University Press, 1972) at 509, 511, reprinted online athttp://www.tertullian.org/articles/evans_marc/ evans_marc_12book5_eng.htm.) &gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Macarius Magnes</strong> ca. 300 Macarius Magnes, Apocriticus, III.30-36 (ca. 300) writes derisively of Paul's inconsistencies when talking of the Law: [Paul] says, ‘As many as are under the Law are under a curse’ (Gal 3:10). The man who writes to the Romans, ‘The Law is spiritual’ (7:14), and again, ‘The Law is holy and the commandment holy and just’ (7:12), places under a curse those who obey that which is holy!... In his Epistles … he praises virginity (I-Tim 4:1, I-Cor 7:25), and then turns round and writes, ‘In the latter times some shall depart from the faith,... forbidding to marry’ (I-Tim 4:1-3).... And in the Epistle to the Corinthians he says, ‘But concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord’ (I-Cor 7:25). &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Methodius</strong> Circa 311 A.D. Methodius, bishop of a see somewhere in Lycia, perhaps at Olympus wrote of Paul: ‘You should not be upset by the sudden shifts in Paul’s arguments, which give the impression that he is confusing the issue or dragging in irrelevant material or merely wool-gathering.... In all his transitions he never introduces anything that would be irrelevant to his teaching; but gathering up all his ideas into a wonderfully harmonious pattern, he makes all bear on the single point which he has in view.’ (Symposium III, 3.)

Letters) Augustine of Hippo, Letter 28, to Jerome (394):&nbsp;<strong>Abelard</strong>, 1142 AD, Say Paul At Odds With What Christ Approved Peter Abelard, Letters of Direction (before 1142): We know of course that when writing to the Thessalonians the Apostle [Paul] sharply rebuked certain idle busybodies by saying that ‘A man who will not work shall not eat.’... But was not Mary sitting idle in order to listen to the words of Christ, while Martha was ... grumbling rather enviously about her sister's repose?</span>

<li>I have been reading also some writings ascribed to you, on the Epistles of the Apostle Paul. In reading your exposition of the Epistle to the Galatians,... most disastrous consequences must follow upon our believing that anything false is found in the sacred books: that is to say, that the men by whom the Scripture has been given to us and committed to writing, did put down in these books anything false.... For if you once admit into such a high sanctuary of authority one false statement as made in the way of duty, there will not be left a single sentence of those books which, if appearing to any one difficult in practice or hard to believe, may not by the same fatal rule be explained away, as a statement in which intentionally and under a sense of duty, the author declared what was not true.... If indeed Peter seemed to (Paul) to be doing what was right, and if notwithstanding, he, in order to soothe troublesome opponents, both said and wrote that Peter did what was wrong— if we say thus,... nowhere in the sacred books shall the authority of pure truth stand sure. ||</li>
<li>Letter 40 (397 AD): If it be possible for men to say and believe that, after introducing his narrative with these words, ‘The things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not’, the apostle (Paul) lied when he said of Peter and Barnabas, ‘I saw that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel’,... [then] if they did walk uprightly, Paul wrote what was false; and if he wrote what was false here, when did he say what was true? &gt;Jerome's Low View of Paul in 411 A.D. Jerome severely criticizes Paul for lack of clarity, and giving feints difficult to understand.</li>
<li>Jerome translated the Greek NT in 411 A.D. into the Latin Vulgate. Jerome in his <em>Commentary</em> on Galatians and Ephesians wrote: "Paul does not know how to develop a hyperbaton [i.e., a change of normal word order for emphasis], nor to conclude a sentence; and having to do with rude people, he has employed the conceptions, which, if, at the outset, he had not taken care to announce as spoken after the manner of men, would have shocked men of good sense." (Gaussen, Theopneusty (1844): 119 quoting Comm. Galatians Bk 11, titl. Bk 1, i.1; and Comm. Ephesians Bk. 11: 3.1; also quoted in Methodist Review at 602.) In other words, Paul is difficult to understand, as Second Peter says. Paul's writing and grammar is atrocious to decipher. And his arguments use terrible and shocking analysis that requires one to pick apart what he says to prevent him from meaning the opposite of what he is saying. Thus, one may be able to untangle Paul's word meanings, Jerome seems to imply, but it is very rough going. Obviously, basing doctrine on Paul was regarded as precarious in the early church.</li>

(Albert Schweitzer, Out of My Life and Thought (1931) "What is the significance for our faith and for our religious life, of the fact that the Gospel of Paul is different from the Gospel of Jesus?...

It is not the business of the historian to controvert or explain these matters; the question of their ultimate significance depends upon the theologian; the historian's concern is merely with the fact that <strong><em>official Christianity throughout the world adopted St. Paul's view so plainly expressed in his epistiles </em></strong>[953] and so untraceable in the gospels, that the meaning of religion lay not in the future, but in the past, and that Jesus was not so much a teacher of wonderful new things, as a predestinate divine blood sacrifice of deep mystery and sacredness made in atonement of a particular historical act of disobedience to the Creator committed by our first parents, Adam and Eve, in response to the temptation of a serpent in the Garden of Eden.

<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Herbert A.L. Fisher</strong>,<em> A History of Europe</em> (1935): "Paul of Tarsus ... drew a clear line of division between [the] two sects.... Christian and Jew sprang apart."</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>LUDWIG WITTENSTEIN</strong>, 1937, distinguished philosopher "The spring which flows gently and limpidly in the Gospels seems to have froth on it in Paul's Epistles.... To me it's as though <strong><em>I saw human passion here [i.e., in Paul], something like pride or anger, which is not in tune with the humility of the Gospels.</em></strong> It's as though he is insisting <strong><em>here on his own person, and doing so moreover as a religious gesture, which is foreign to the Gospel</em></strong>. I want to ask--and may this be no blasphemy--'What might Christ have said to Paul?'... <strong><em>In the Gospels--as it seems to me--everything is less pretentious, humbler, simpler</em></strong>. There you find huts; in Paul a church. <strong><em>There all men are equal </em></strong>and God himself is a man; in <strong><em>Paul there is already something like a hierarchy, honours and official positions</em></strong>." (Ludwig Wittgenstein, Culture and Value (1980, notes from 1937) &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>WIL DURANT</strong>, 1944, historian "Paul created a theology of which none but the vaguest warrants can be found in the words of Christ.... Through these interpretations <strong><em>Paul could neglect the actual life and sayings of Jesus, which he had not directly known</em></strong>.... He had replaced conduct with creed as the test of virtue. It was a tragic change." (W. Durant, Caesar and Christ (1944) at 588 (vaguest warrant); 589 (neglect); 592 (tragic change) &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Paul Schubert</strong>, 'Urgent Tasks for New Testament Research', in H.R. Willoughby (ed.), The Study of the Bible Today and Tomorrow (1947): "As regards Paul and his letters there is no notable agreement [among modern theologians] on any major issue."</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>ROBERT FROST</strong>, 1947, poet "Paul: he’s in the Bible too. He is the<strong><em> fellow who theologized Christ almost out of Christianity. Look out for him</em></strong>." (Robert Frost, A Masque of Mercy, 1947) &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>HERBERT J. MULLER</strong>, 1952 "Saul of Tarsus, who became St. Paul,... knew Jesus only by hearsay, and rarely referred to his human life....<strong><em> Paul preached a gospel about Jesus that was not taught by the Jesus of the synoptic Gospels.</em></strong>... Setting himself against [the] other disciples,... he was largely responsible for the violent break with Judaism.... He contributed a <strong><em>radical dualism of flesh and spirit unwarranted by the teachings of Jesus</em></strong>." (Muller, Uses of the Past (Oxford University, 1952) at 157 (hearsay, not taught by Jesus); 160 (unwarranted).)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Nikos Kazantzakis</strong>, The Last Temptation of Christ (1955): "The door opened. A squat, fat hunchback, still young, but bald, stood on the threshold. His eyes were spitting fire.... 'Are you Saul?' Jesus asked, horrified.... 'I am Paul. I was saved--glory be to God!--and now I've set out to save the world....' 'My fine lad,' Jesus replied, 'I've already come back from where you're headed...<strong><em>. Did you see this resurrected Jesus of Nazareth?' Jesus bellowed. 'Did you see him with your own eyes? What was he like?' 'A flash of lightning--a flash of lightning which spoke.' 'Liar!</em></strong>... What blasphemies you utter! What effronteries! What lies! Is it with such lies, swindler, that you dare to save the world?' Now it was Paul's turn to explode. 'Shut your shameless mouth!' he shouted.... 'I don't give a hoot about what's true and what's false, or whether I saw him or didn't see him.'"</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>W.D. DAVIES</strong>, 1958 "Jewish-Christians [opposing Paul] ... must have been a very strong, widespread element in the earliest days of the Church.... They took for granted that the gospel was continuous with Judaism.... According to some scholars, they must have been so strong<strong><em> that right up to the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70 they were the dominant element in the Christian movement.</em></strong>" W.D. Davies, 'Paul and Jewish Christianity', in J. Daniélou (ed.), Théologie du Judéo-Chriantianisme (Paris: 1958) &gt;Lawrence Durrell, Clea (1960): For a brief moment [freedom] looked possible, but St. Paul restored ... the iron handcuffs. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>HANS JOACHIM SCHOEPS</strong>, 1961 "[Drawing a] stark contrast between the religion of the law and the religion of grace,... <strong><em>Paul had lost all understanding of the character of the Hebraic berith [covenant] as a partnership involving mutual obligations</em></strong>, [and thus] he failed to grasp the inner meaning of the Mosaic law." (Hans Joachim Schoeps, Paul: The Theology of the Apostle in the Light of Jewish Religious History (English translation 1961).) &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Erich Fromm</strong>, <em>The Dogma of Chris</em>t (1963): "Paul appealed ... to some of the wealthy and educated class, especially merchants, who by means of their adventures and travels had a decided importance for the diffusion of Christianity.... [This] <strong><em>had been the religion of a community of equal brothers, without hierarchy or bureaucracy</em></strong>, [but] was converted into 'the Church', the <strong><em>reflected image of the absolute monarchy of the Roman Empire."</em></strong></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Gilles Quispel</strong>, 'Gnosticism and the New Testament', in J. Philip Hyatt (ed.), The Bible in Modern Scholarship (papers read at the 100th meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature, 1964): "The Christian community of Jerusalem ... did not accept [Paul's] views on the [Mosaic] Law."</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Emil G. Kraeling</strong>, <em>The Disciples</em> (1966): "The peculiar, unharmonized relationship between Paul and the Twelve that existed from the beginning was never fully adjusted.... Modern Biblical research in particular has <strong><em>made it difficult to put the religion of the New Testament (to say nothing of the Bible as a whole) into the straightjacket of Paulinism</em></strong>."</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Paul Tillich</strong>, <em>A History of Christian Thought</em> (1968): "The [Mosaic] law was not evaluated in the negative way in which we usually do it; for the Jews it was a gift and a joy.... The way of despair ... was the way of people like Paul, Augustine, and Luther.... Paul's conflict with the Jewish Christians did not have to be continued. Instead of that, the positive elements in the faith, which could provide an understandable content for the pagans, had to be brought out. "</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Joseph Campbell</strong>, <em>The Masks of God: Creative Mythology</em> (1968): The reign in Europe of that order of unreason, unreasoning submission to the dicta of authority:... Saint Paul himself had opened the door to such impudent idiocies. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Günther Bornkamm</strong>, <em>Paul </em>(1969): Above all there results the chasm which separates Jesus from Paul and the conclusion that more than the historical Jesus ... it is Paul who really founded Christianity.... Already during his lifetime Paul was considered an illegitimate Apostle and a falsifier of the Christian message.... For a long time, Judeo-Christianity rejected him completely, as a rival to Peter and James, the brother of the Lord.... Paul does not connect immediately with ... [the] words ... of the earthly Jesus. Everything seems to indicate that he didn't even know them. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>William Steuart McBirnie</strong>, <em>The Search for the Twelve Apostles</em> (1973): Why did Jesus choose only twelve chief Apostles? Obviously, to correspond to the twelve tribes of Israel.... Paul stoutly maintained that he also was an Apostle.... Yet there is no evidence that he was ever admitted to that inner circle of the original Twelve.... Those who expect the Acts to be the complete early history of Christianity are doomed to disappointment.... The Bible student is soon, and perhaps unconsciously, caught up in the personal ministry of Paul. Peter, though prominent at first, is later ignored, as the Acts unfolds for the reader the story of Paul and his friends.... There is absolutely no evidence that Paul ever recognized the 'primacy' of Peter. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Ronald Brownrigg</strong>, <em>The Twelve Apostles</em> (1974): The letters of Paul present a marked contrast to Luke's writings [in his Gospel and the Acts]. Whereas Luke suggests that the Apostles were a closed corporation of twelve governing the whole Church, Paul disagrees, claiming his own Apostleship to be as valid as any of the twelve.... Certainly Paul knew no authority of the twelve.... The qualification for Apostleship, at the election of Matthias [Ac 1:15-26], had been a divinely guided selection and a constant companionship with Jesus throughout his [active] lifetime. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Elaine H. Pagels</strong>, <em>The Gnostic Paul</em> (1975): Two antithetical traditions of Pauline exegesis have emerged from the late first century through the second. Each claims to be authentic, Christian, and Pauline: but one reads Paul anti-gnostically, the other gnostically.... Whoever takes account of the total evidence may learn from the debate to approach Pauline exegesis with renewed openness to the text. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong><em>Irving Howe</em></strong>, <em>World of our Fathers</em> (1976): The view that sexual activity is impure or at least suspect, so often an accompaniment of Christianity, was seldom entertained in the [east-European Jewish] shtetl. Paul's remark that it is better to marry than to burn would have seemed strange, if not downright impious, to the Jews. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Patrick Henry</strong>, <em>New Directions in New Testament Study</em> (1979): There remains in the popular mind a strong suspicion ... that Paul corrupted Christianity (or even founded a different religion).... Jesus [was] a teacher in the mainstream of Jewish prophetic piety,... while Paul ... takes the irrevocable step away from Judaism of rejecting the [Mosaic] law.... Paul imported into the Christian community a form of religion characteristic of the 'mysteries',... religious movements of initiation into secret rites and esoteric knowledge. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Juan Luis Segundo</strong>, <em>The Person of Today confronting Jesus of Nazareth</em> (1982): "Within less than thirty years of the events narrated by the synoptics concerning the life and proclamation, death and resurrection of Jesus, Paul permits himself to compose a long and complex exposition of what this means, retaining, apparently, only the two final specific events, the death and the resurrection. Jesus' words are not cited (with the exception of those pronounced over the bread and wine at the Last Supper), his teachings are not remembered. The key terms have disappeared which he employed to designate himself, his mission and his immediate audience: the Son of Man, the Kingdom of God, the poor."</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Yigael Yadin</strong>, 'The Temple Scroll--the Longest Dead Sea Scroll',<em> Biblical Archaeology Review</em> (Sept/Oct 1984): We must distinguish between the various layers, or strata, to use an archaeological term, of early Christianity. The theology, the doctrines and the practices of Jesus, John the Baptist and Paul ... are not the same. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>James Michener</strong>, <em>Legacy</em> (1987): Women ... will no longer kowtow to the fulminations of St. Paul. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Paula Fredriksen</strong>, <em>From Jesus to Christ</em> (1988): Scholars, their confusion facilitated by Paul's own apparent inconsistency,... do not agree even on what Paul said, much less why he said it. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>HELMUT KOESTER</strong>, 1990, scholar on Paul "Paul stands in the twilight zone of heresy...." (Helmut Koester, "The Theological Aspects of Primitive Christian Heresy," in James Robinson (ed.), <em>The Future of our Religious Past</em> (N.Y.: Harper &amp; Row, 1971). "One immediately encounters a major difficulty. Whatever Jesus had preached did not become the content of the missionary proclamation of Paul, nor of the churches from which his proclamation took its origin...." (Helmut Koester, Ancient Christian Gospels (1990) at 51.) "Sayings of Jesus do not play a role in Paul's understanding of the event of salvation.... The Epistle of James also shares with the Sermon on the Mount the rejection of the Pauline thesis that Christ is the end of the [Mosaic] law. || Paul did not care at all what Jesus had said.... Had Paul been completely successful, very little of the sayings of Jesus would have survived." (Helmut Koester with Stephen Patterson, "The Gospel of Thomas: Does It Contain Authentic Sayings of Jesus?," Bible Review (April 1990) Vol. 6 No. 2 at 28-39 &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Stephen Mitchell</strong>, <em>The Gospel according to Jesus</em> (1991): Paul of Tarsus ... [was] the most misleading of the earliest Christian writers,... [and] a particularly difficult character: arrogant, self-righteous, filled with murderous hatred of his opponents, terrified of God, oppressed by what he felt as the burden of the [Mosaic] Law, overwhelmed by his sense of sin.... He didn't understand Jesus at all. He wasn't even interested in Jesus; just in his own idea of the Christ. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Shlomo Riskin</strong>, <em>The Jerusalem Post International Edition</em> (March 28, 1992): Saul of Tarsus ... broke from Jewish Law, and the religion thereby created was soon encrusted with pagan elements. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Dennis J. Trisker &amp; Vera V. Martínez T</strong>., <em>They Also Believe</em> (1992): While many persons believe that Christianity was founded by Jesus Christ,... it is due to Paul that there exists the organization called Christian.... In the New Testament, we can see how Paul ... was in disagreement with the church in Jerusalem and even held in suspicion by them.... He did not emphasize the Jewish aspect of the teaching, and this brought about the first separation within the church. Across the years this separation widened, making the church more pagan and less Jewish.... Paul was no Apostle. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Xavier Zubiri</strong>, <em>The Philosophical Problem of the History of Religions</em> (1993): There is absolutely no doubt that much of St. Paul's terminology derives from the Mystery Religions. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>BART EHRMAN</strong>, 1993, scholar "What did the historical Jesus teach in comparison with what the historical Paul taught?… Jesus taught that to escape judgment a person must keep the central teachings of the Jewish Law as he, Jesus himself, interpreted them. Paul, interestingly enough, never mentions Jesus’ interpretation of the [Mosaic] Law, and Paul was quite insistent that keeping the Law would never bring Salvation. The only way to be saved, for Paul, was to trust Jesus’ death and resurrection… Paul transformed the religion of Jesus into a religion about Jesus." (Bart D. Ehrman, The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture, 1993) &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Alan F. Segal </strong>(for Eugene Schwartz), 'Electronic Echoes: Using Computer Concordances for Bible Study',<em> Biblical Archaeology Review</em> (Nov/Dec 1997): We can easily quantify allusions by measuring whether a passage in one Biblical work merely repeats a few words of another or whether it directly quotes several words running.... The results of our research seemed to confirm ... very few clear parallels between Paul and the Gospels.... [They] almost always express [even] the same ideas in completely different words.... I am unconvinced by the myriad rather weak parallels between the Gospels and Paul. Rather,... the [computer] word study seems to show that the two are definitely unrelated. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Georg Baboukis</strong>, On the Way to One God (1999): Paul ... is the real founder of Christianity as we live it today, which is completely different from the Christianity of Jesus. &gt;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>THOMAS COSETTE</strong>, 2007, independent Christian "This man Paul hijacked what is called the church....But he can only keep those who do not love the truth. Those who still have conscience and will compare his teaching and his testimony to Y'shva's and the prophets without granting Paul's testimony [is] the Word of God but [is] just another man's testimony in light of Jesus' teachings. Then they will discover that Paul usurps the truth...." (Thomas Cosette, <em>Hebrew Prophecies of the Coming of Paul</em> (2007)</span></li>
