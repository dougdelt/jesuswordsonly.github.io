<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><img src="/images/stories/christ-the-redeemer.jpg" alt="christ-the-redeemer" width="250" height="190" style="margin-left: 10px; float: right;" /><span style="font-size: 24pt;">Sabbath Command</span>:</span></h1>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Applicable to Gentiles in Community of Israel 1250 BC?</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The Sabbath is commanded to be observed by one of the Ten Commandments issued to Moses in 1250 BC. (Ex 20:8.) In the first century AD, Jesus taught the Law was still to be observed by His disciples until the heavens and earth pass away. (Matt. 5:17-19.) Jesus regularly observed Sabbath, and attended service readings of the Law. (Luke 4:16.) Luke personally did likewise. See Acts 16:13. The early Christian church attended Sabbath services as well. (Acts 13:42-43, Barnabas and Paul attended synagogue on Sabbath, and Jews and Gentiles ("devout proselytes") begged another sermon about Christ from them on the next Sabbath.)&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">However, be aware that to make it appear plausible that Sunday became the only day of convocation in the early church, the KJV translated "mia ton <strong>Sabbaton</strong>" in Luke's Acts as "first day of the week." Instead, it means simply "one of the Sabbath<strong>s</strong>" -- a plural for Sabbath, proving there is no meaning of the "first day of the week" -- which would require a singular Sabbath be present. (See our article at this <a href="/recommendedreading/540-first-day-of-week-versus-one-of-the-sabbaths.html">link</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The Sabbath-command applies to sojourners / foreigners (<em>i.e.</em>, Gentiles) just as much as to Sons of Israel. See Deut. 5:12-15; Lev. 25:6; Exo 23:12.&nbsp;(On what part of the Law applies to Gentiles, see our discussion at this <a href="/recommendedreading/98-law-applicable-today.html">link</a></span>.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Influence on Gentiles</span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #000000;">The seven day week is a universal phenomenon (coincidence?), tracing back to the Babylonians after they captured the Israelites and brought them to Babylon. The Bablyonians practiced it by 600 BC, coinciding with the captivity of the Jews, with the holy day being the "seventh day" of the week (<em>i.e.</em>, today&rsquo;s Saturday). (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-day_week"><span style="color: #000000;">Wikipedia</span></a>.) While they did not apparently call it Sabbath, it functioned that way. Hence, apparently many Gentiles were generally following this practice outside of Israel by at least 600 BC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">India / Hindus had a seven day week by about 100 BC, with an equivalent to Saturday as the seventh day. China in the 4th Century AD adopted the seven day week, influenced by the Christian Manichean sect.&nbsp;<em>Id.&nbsp;</em>Japan adopted the seven day week as early as 1007 AD. <em>Id.</em>&nbsp;And now it is truly universal</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><em><br /></em><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">God's Promise of Salvation to Gentiles Links It To Obedience to the Seventh-Day Sabbath</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The promise in Isaiah 56 of salvation to Gentiles ("my salvation is about to come", <a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/56-1.htm">56:1</a>) was predicated on two things: "<strong>keep the Sabbath</strong> from profaning it and <strong>keep his hand from doing evil.</strong>" (Isaiah <a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/56-2.htm">56:2</a>) or "who <strong>keep My Sabbaths</strong>, and choose things that please Me, and<strong> take hold of my covenant</strong>." (Isaiah <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/kjv/isaiah/passage.aspx?q=isaiah+56:4;isaiah+56:6">56:4,6</a>). The term 'covenant' is a short-hand reference of the Ten Commandments. This is why the two tablets kept in a special "Ark" box was called the Ark of the Covenant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Essentially, the salvation of a Gentile -- according to God's word -- turns on obeying the Sabbath and keeping from evil as outlined in His covenant, <em>i.e.</em>, taking hold of at least those commands in the ten commandments which apply&nbsp;expressly to sojourners / foreigners. This includes clearly the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">God promises eunuchs in return for obedience that "I will give them an everlasting name which will not be cut off." (Isaiah <a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/56-5.htm">56:5</a>.) God similarly then promises the Gentiles / "foreigners" (who similarly obey) that "I will bring to My holy mountain And&nbsp;make them joyful in My house of prayer," and "their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be acceptable on&nbsp;My altar...." (Isaiah <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+56&amp;version=NASB">56:7</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><img src="/images/Isaiah_56_6-7.png" alt="Isaiah 56 6-7" width="430" height="168" style="float: right;" /></span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Early Church Was Predominantly Obedient On Sabbath</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In obvious reliance upon Jesus (and hence rejection of <a href="/recommendedreading/242-paul-abolished-sabbath.html">Paul's abolition of Sabbath</a>), the early church continued to obey Sabbath on what is Saturday today for several hundred years after Christ while worshipping either on our present Saturday or on the Lord's Day - our present Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The Ante-Nicene church records from 125 A.D. to 325 A.D. clearly show the church's general practice was:</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Bingham, a Christian scholar, summarizes numerous ancient sources besides <strong>Constitutions </strong>and confirms this was the overwhelming practice of the early church: "The ancient Christians were very careful in the observation of <strong>Saturday</strong>, or the seventh day... It is plain that all the Oriental [Eastern] churches, and the greatest part of the world, <strong>observed the Sabbath as a festival</strong>... Athanasius likewise tells us that they held religious assemblies on the Sabbath, not because they were infected with Judaism,<strong> but to worship Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath</strong>, Epiphanius says the same." (Joseph Bingham, <strong>Antiquities of the Christian Church</strong> (1878) Vol. II, Bk. xx, Ch. 3, Sec. 1, 66. 1137,1136). See also Bingham, <strong>Works of Bingham</strong> at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FwFKAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Bingham%2C%20Antiquities%20of%20the%20Christian%20Church&amp;pg=PA542#v=onepage&amp;q=sabbath&amp;f=false">542</a> ("Sabbath of every week was observed in many churches;" <em>Id</em>. at<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FwFKAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Bingham%2C%20Antiquities%20of%20the%20Christian%20Church&amp;pg=PA543#v=onepage&amp;q=sabbath&amp;f=false"> 543</a> (communion was sometimes on Sabbath but typically on Sunday.) <em>See also</em> Bingham, <strong>Antiquities of the Christian Church</strong> Vol. IV at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=opwHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Bingham%2C%20Antiquities%20of%20the%20Christian%20Church&amp;pg=RA1-PA233#v=onepage&amp;q=sabbath&amp;f=false">233</a> (quotes Athanasius again).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This means the Sabbath persisted for these several hundred years despite Paul's pronouncement in 50 AD that the Sabbath was abolished. (See <a href="/recommendedreading/242-paul-abolished-sabbath.html">our</a> link on Paul's words doing so</span>.)</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Etymological Practices That Speak Volumes Proving Persistent Early Observance</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This explains why if you spoke a European language today, you would be&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">using the word "Sabbath" for day seven of each week instead of "Saturn's-Day" -- Saturday in English. In Spanish, day seven is "Sabado" -- Sabbath, not "Saturno." In Italy, day seven is "Sabato" -- not "Saturno." In Russian -- &nbsp;Subbota; in Portguese ---&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">S&aacute;bado.&nbsp;In Romanian --- S&acirc;mbat. In Greek -- Savato. In Armenian - Shabat. In Georgian - Sabati,&nbsp;etc. ("<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week-day_names">Weekday Names</a>," <em>Wikipedia</em>.) In fact, even outside Europe we find Sabbath continues as the name used in many nations simply modified to their language: Somalia -Sabti; Arabic - as-Sabt; Malta - Is-Sibt; Malaysia - Sabtu; Indonesia - Sabtu; and Sudan - Sabtu.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Further, the Didache from 100-200 AD is confirmed as correct that "Sunday" was at the same time kept weekly as the "Lord's Day" <strong>distinct</strong> from the Sabbath for rest. The European tongues likewise all call our English "Sun-Day" the "Lord's Day,"&nbsp;<em>i.e.</em>, "<strong>Domingo</strong>" (Spanish) and "<strong>Domenica</strong>" (Italian), etc. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">As&nbsp;<em>Answers.com</em> explains, English is <strong>anomolous</strong> in erasing the faith-aspect of what originally was present - "Sabbath" and the "Lord's Day" for days seven and one:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In Spanish, that leaves the words for Saturday and Sunday that weren't adopted using the Roman naming pattern.&nbsp;</span><em style="font-family: Verdana; line-height: 18px;">Domingo</em><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">, the word for Sunday, comes from a Latin word meaning "Lord's day." And&nbsp;</span><em style="font-family: Verdana; line-height: 18px;">s&aacute;bado</em><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">, the word for Saturday, <strong>comes from the Hebrew word Sabbath, meaning a day of rest</strong> (in Jewish and Christian tradition, God rested on the seventh day of creation). ("<a href="http://spanish.about.com/od/historyofspanish/a/names_of_days.htm">Names of Days</a>").</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This is an etymological proof that there was such a long standing original Sabbath-observance practice that Spaniards, Italians, Portuguese, Romanians, Greeks, Russians, etc., refused to buckle in the 300s when the name change was being enforced. These Europeans to this day call day seven "Sabbath."</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The British Christians were more pagan and amenable to change. When in the 300s AD Rome insisted they adopt a celestial god's name to be associated with each day (see next section), they had no problem using "Saturn" -- Saturday -- for Sabbath, and the "Sun-god" for Sunday -- the Lord's Day. As <a href="http://webclipart.about.com/od/Calendar_Clip_Art/ss/Origins-Of-The-English-Names-For-The-Days-Of-The-Week.htm"><em>Origins of the English Names for the Days of the Week Explains</em></a>:&nbsp;"English, like most of the Germanic languages, preserves the <strong>original pagan/sun associations of the day</strong>."</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">(This is similar to the English calling Jesus' Passion week "Easter" after the goddess "Eostre" -- Saxon for Osiris, but in Spain and Italy it is still called "Passover" -- Pascua and Pasqua respectively -- the Spaniards and Italians </span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><em>et al.,&nbsp;</em></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span></span></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">retaining the passion's original spiritual connection to the Hebrew feast of Passover).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">When Did The Rules Change?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Sabbath was the universal day of rest until Rome in the early 300s tried to wipe it out. Then in 321 A.D., Rome, at Emperor Constantine's insistence, instituted the observance of a day of rest to his pagan Sun-god, <em>i.e.</em>, Sun-Day. (See <a href="/recommendedreading/239-council-of-nicea-of-325-ad.html">our </a>link.) &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Constantine by law was Pontifex Maximus. &nbsp;This title made him the supreme Priest aka Bishop of the Catholic Church and all non-Christian religions at Rome. Thus when he issued a civil law making Sunday a worship day to the Sun-god &mdash; his pagan Sun-god which he retained despite claiming in 324 AD that he also had been a Christian since 315AD, everyone had to comply and observe Sun-day to honor Sol Invictus --- meaning the pagan god whose name means the Unconquered Sun. As <em>Wikipedia</em> under "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath">Sabbath</a>" records:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The Roman Catholic Church gradually adopted thereafter Sun-day as a day of rest in place of the traditional Sabbath. As Eusebius explains in the 330s in his commentary on Psalms, a Sabbath rest should now be on Sunday and "we" (the Roman Church to which he belonged) "<strong>transferred</strong>" the Sabbath to Sun-day, the Lord's Day:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"And all things that were duty to do on the Sabbath, these <strong>we have transferred to the Lord's day</strong>, as more appropriately belong to it, because it has precedence and is first in rank, and more honorable than the Jewish sabbath."

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In 336 AD, at the Council of Laodicea, the Roman Catholic Church without shame declared it had the power to move Sabbath to Sunday.

<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In 363 AD, Catholicism Curses Sabbath-Keepers</span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">It was only in 363 A.D. that the Roman Catholic Church went so far as to make it a heresy and anathema to rest on the Saturday-Sabbath.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Council of Laodicea of 363 A.D.&mdash;one of the first church councils controlled primarily by the Roman Bishop&mdash;it was decided to deem heretical and anathema (cursed) the practice of keeping Sabbath. (Canon 29.)&nbsp; (<em>Nicene and PostNicene Fathers </em>(1990), supra, XIV at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5oEXAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=if%20any%20shall%20be%20found%20to%20be%20judaizers%2C%20let%20them%20be%20anathema%20from%20Christ&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=if%20any%20shall%20be%20found%20to%20be%20judaizers,%20let%20them%20be%20anathema%20from%20Christ&amp;f=false">148</a>.) This officially declared Sabbath was moved to Sunday.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The Council claimed Sabbath-keeping was &ldquo;judaizing.&rdquo; (See next quote below.) Even though the term "judaizing" is <strong>not found in the NT</strong>, this was how by 363 AD Roman Catholicism came to describe the enemies of Paul's doctrine in Galatians even as the <strong>Catholics were embracing Paul's anti-law positions</strong>. The Catholic Church now claimed any effort to follow the Law given Moses (besides faith) <strong>severs one from Christ</strong>. Hence, Roman Catholicism now wielded as a pejorative the term "judaizer" against those who resisted &nbsp;the Roman rulers' decrees that Sabbath as Saturday was abolished in favor of Sun-Day &nbsp;(<strong>Nicene and Post Nicene Fathers</strong>&nbsp;</span><em style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.3em;">&nbsp;</em><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">(1990), supra, XIV at </span><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5oEXAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=if%20any%20shall%20be%20found%20to%20be%20judaizers%2C%20let%20them%20be%20anathema%20from%20Christ&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=if%20any%20shall%20be%20found%20to%20be%20judaizers,%20let%20them%20be%20anathema%20from%20Christ&amp;f=false" style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.3em;">148</a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">.)

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Christians must not judaize by resting on the <strong>Sabbath, but must work on that&nbsp;day</strong>, rather, honoring the Lord&rsquo;s day [<em>i.e.</em>, Sunday]; and, if they can, resting then as Christians. But if any shall be found to be&nbsp;judaizers, let them be anathema from Christ. <em>Id.,&nbsp;</em>at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5oEXAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=if%20any%20shall%20be%20found%20to%20be%20judaizers%2C%20let%20them%20be%20anathema%20from%20Christ&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=if%20any%20shall%20be%20found%20to%20be%20judaizers,%20let%20them%20be%20anathema%20from%20Christ&amp;f=false">148</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Heroically but without effect, a Roman Catholic Archbishop of Baltimore, Cardinal&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gibbons">James Gibbons</a>,&nbsp;tried to confess this error. &nbsp;Perhaps he hoped Catholicism would reverse this error. Gibbons wrote in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>The Faith of Our Fathers</strong> (1917) that &ldquo;you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures <strong>enforce the religious observance of Saturday</strong>, a day which we [Catholics] never sanctify.&rdquo; (<em>Id.</em>, at 89.) He similarly wrote elsewhere:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"For example, <strong>nowhere</strong> in the Bible do we find that Christ or the Apostles ordered that the <strong>Sabbath be changed from Saturday to Sunday</strong>. We have the commandment of God given to Moses to keep holy the Sabbath day, that is the 7th day of the week, Saturday. Today most Christians keep Sunday because it has been revealed to us by the Church <strong>outside the Bible</strong>." &nbsp;("To Tell You The Truth," <em>Catholic Virginian</em> (Oct. 3, 1947) page 9, quoted in "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gibbons#cite_note-3">Gibbons</a>," Wikipedia.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hence, Gibbons implied the church could with equal authority change it back to what the Bible dictated. Gibbons' subtelty apparently was too subtle, and no one listened</span>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul in 500s Cited By Catholicism To Curse Sabbath-Keepers</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Despite heavy pressure from Catholicism beginning in the 300s to end Sabbath observance, many Christians resisted. Good Christians tried to continue resting on Sabbath as had been the tradition from Christ to the late 300s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In the 500s, Pope <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_I">Gregory the Great</a> (540-604 AD) actually claimed that anyone who wished to still keep the Sabbath by resting from work besides worshipping on the Lord's Day [<em>i.e.</em>, on Sunday] had <strong>the spirit of the Anti-Christ</strong>. Not only that, the pope, <strong>relying upon Paul's words in Galatians 5:2</strong>, clearly implied that those observing Sabbath were now cut off from Christ. The pope equated them to persons who must endorse circumcision too for Gentiles -- a red-herring:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"What else can I call these but preachers of the <strong>Anti-Christ</strong>...he must say too that the commandment of circumcision of the body is to be retained. But let him hear <strong>the apostle Paul</strong> saying in opposition 'If you be circumcised, Christ profits you nothing.' Gal. 5:2.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">(Philip Schaff, <strong>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Second Series </strong>(2007) Volume XIII <strong>Gregory the Great</strong> at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lE_TafAcVkUC&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=intitle%3ANicene%20intitle%3Aand%20intitle%3APost-nicene%20intitle%3Afathers%20judaizing%20sabbath&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">92</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">As one can see, the Roman Catholic church<strong> knew Paul was its ally to abolish Sabbath </strong>to conform to the desires of the Roman state. And this was the period where Rome (the state) wished to do away with Sabbath -- a costly second day of rest during a 7 day week. (Rome could not afford our current 2 days of rest of both Saturday and Sunday.) Rome -- the state -- instead required all citizens to worship and rest on Sun-Day (<em>i.e.</em>, the day of Sol Invictus, the god-of-the-Sun.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul's Writings Beginning in 300s Are Elevated To Support Christian Worship on Day of Sun-God</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Thus, it was precisely in this period when <strong>Paul's writings for the first time were taken very seriously</strong>, and were now officially promoted. As Thomas F. Martin in "<a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_early_christian_studies/v008/8.2martin.html">Vox Pauli</a>," in the <strong>Journal of Early Christian Studies</strong> says:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"From the mid-300s&nbsp;<small class="caps">C.E.</small> to the mid-400s, there was a<strong> marked turn towards the figure and theology of Paul</strong>, indicated by the flurry of commentaries on Pauline letters written during that period." (<strong>Journal of Early Christian Studies</strong> - Volume 8, Number 2, Summer 2000, pp. 237-272.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Despite the Western church's <strong>late turn towards Paul,</strong> the Catholic rulings abolishing Sabbath on Saturday in 336 AD and again in 363 AD at Rome were apparently never fully accepted outside of Roman territories. The Eastern Orthodox outside the USA have always maintained the Sabbath is Saturday not Sunday. One source says: "Orthodox Christians continue to celebrate Saturday as Sabbath." ("<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath_in_Christianity#Eastern_Christianity">Sabbath in Christianity</a>," <em>Wikipedia</em>.) </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Incidentally, the Eastern Orthodox Church of America's current position is that we need not obey Sabbath any more, in reliance upon Paul's principles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In time, Roman Catholicism even hardened its position further in favor of Paulinism's anti-Law position. Thomas Aquinas in the 1200s went so far as to say that <strong>practicing ritual elements of the Mosaic law</strong> (which he said included the Sabbath rest) was a <strong>mortal sin</strong>, as it was tantamount to denying that the Messiah had come. (Aquinas, St Thomas (1981) <strong>Summa Theologiae</strong>&nbsp;(Christian Classics) at 3020, referenced in "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gibbons#cite_note-3">Gibbons</a>,"&nbsp;<em>Wikipedia</em>.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Doesn't the Bible speak of this -- &nbsp;about the ones calling darkness light, and light darkness? (See <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">What is the consequence of abandoning Sabbath even though God said it applies to foreigners in community with Israel?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>God will only remember His children</strong> by those who&nbsp;<strong>keep His Sabbaths</strong>.

<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Daniel 7:25: Prophecy of Changing The Law and Times and Seasons</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Some say the Roman Catholic Church is the beast of Daniel because in 336 AD and repeated in 363 AD it changed the times and the seasons by moving Sabbath on Saturday to Sunday. See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+7%3A25&amp;version=NIV">Dan. 7:25</a>. Thus, these same voices --- apparently the Adventist church --- claim anyone resting on Sunday has the mark of the beast. I take no position on those claims. But I do want to address an historically inaccurate rebuttal to such claims</span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Error Of Those Who Claim Sabbath Was Never Kept by Predominant Christian Church</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">At a popular website, Sabbath Keepers Refuted, it claims the church never kept Sabbath on Saturday, and if any one set Sunday as Sabbath, it was the Roman government, not the Roman church. Hence, they contend those who obey Sabbath on Sunday do not have the mark of the beast - alleged to be Sunday Sabbatarianism. It claims:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"the universal record of history and the New Testament proves that<strong><em> Christians never kept the Sabbath after the resurrection of Christ</em></strong>." (Sabbath Keepers Refuted, <a href="http://www.bible.ca/7-change-times-seasons-daniel-7-25.htm">Sabbitarians and Mark of the Beast</a>.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The Roman Catholic Church supposedly only later joined in urging Christians to CHANGE from resting on Saturday to Sunday. Later the RCC made this a threatening command.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">As one can see from the above impeccable scholarly sources and early church historians, the statement Christians "never kept the Sabbath" after the resurrection of Christ is untrue. The opposite is the case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Even as of today, the Eastern Orthodox outside America have two milennia of an unbroken history of keeping the Sabbath on Saturday. The Adventists or whoever make these 'mark-of-the-beast' claims are at least historically accurate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Mistranslations Designed to Mislead the Innocent God-Fearing Gentile</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">So why was Sabbath Keepers so insistent? Well, here is an <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ugly secret</strong></span>: the pro-Sunday translators repetitiously mistranslated Luke's descriptions in Acts of church meetings on "<strong>mia ton Sabbaton</strong>" - meaning "<strong>on one of the Sabbaths</strong>" -- as instead "<strong>on the first day of the week</strong>." For an example, see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+20%3A7&amp;version=NIV">Acts 20:7</a> in the KJV. This is literally an<strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"> off-the-wall translation</span></strong>. It has no excuse except to mislead innocent God-fearing people like those at Sabbath Keepers that Sunday was always the day of rest in the early church. For a detailed article at our site, see <a href="/recommendedreading/540-first-day-of-week-versus-one-of-the-sabbaths.html">First Day of the Week? Or On One of the Sabbaths?</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The King James, however, was not always consistent. It clearly has even Paul worshipping on Sabbath. For in Acts 13, we learn:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">13&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">14&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the <strong>sabbath day</strong>, and sat down. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013&amp;version=KJV">Acts 13:13-14</a> KJV.)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul then gives a speech where he mentions the prophets are read every Sabbath day, as if that is a norm he personally experiences. Paul says even in the King James: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">27&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every <strong>sabbath</strong> day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013&amp;version=KJV">Acts 13:27</a> KJV.)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Then Paul agrees to worship and lead a Sabbath observance of apparently new Christian Gentiles the next Sabbath! We read:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">42&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the <strong>Gentiles</strong> besought that these words [from Paul] might be preached to them <strong>the next sabbath</strong>.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">43&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">44&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And the <strong>next sabbath day</strong> came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">45&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and <strong>spake against those things which were spoken by Paul</strong>, contradicting and blaspheming. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+13%3A42-45&amp;version=NIV">Acts 13:42-45</a>.)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hence, the argument Paul only observed Sabbath because Jews followed Sabbath (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+18%3A1%2C4&amp;version=KJV">Acts 18:1,4 KJV</a> "he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath") fails in light of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+13%3A42-45&amp;version=NIV">Acts 13:42-45</a>. There&nbsp;Gentiles asked Paul to meet the next Sabbath with them, <strong>not the Jews</strong>, to hear more of his message. Paul had an opportunity to say there and then that he would meet them on Sunday, not Saturday, but Paul did not do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">So Sabbath Keepers' claim that no Christian followed Sabbath in the early church cannot be defended based upon even the King James Bible which <strong>inconsistently renders the word for Sabbath(s)</strong> as sometimes about <strong>the Sabbath</strong> in reference to Gentiles following Paul, and the day they met was Sabbath, while many other times obscured this fact by translating Sabbath in Greek as the&nbsp;<strong>first day of the week</strong><em>, i.e., </em>Sunday<em>.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Incidentally, the King James Bible is&nbsp;the same Bible that translates the word "pascha" (passover) in Acts as <strong>Easter</strong> to make us think the apostles remembered Jesus' resurrection on the pagan holiday for the goddess Eostre. This is only true today, starting in the 300s under the pagan Constantine who as Pontifex Maximus over the Roman Catholic Church (and all other religions at Rome) moved the celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus from Passover to a day coinciding with the time to worship the goddess Easter (Eostre in Saxon) aka Osiris in Latin. See our article&nbsp;<a href="/recommendedreading/126-appendix-c-easter.html">Easter Error</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">What Day Is Sabbath?</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The Law does not mandate how the sabbath is connected to the lunar cycle. Its first practice as of 1488 BC under the Law was that the first of the month -- the appearance of the new moon was the first Sabbath day of the month. Then every 7 days thereafter was the next Sabbath. After the 28th, there could be 1-2 non-week days added until the next new moon appeared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">However, the law's ambiguity -- actually silence -- on how to calculate the sabbath cycles means the Levitical priests had authority under <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deut 17:8</a> to resolve a difficult legal case such as what dates trigger the sabbath cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">As of 1000 BC, the Jewish religious authorities modified the cycle to what we have today with a slight amendation in 700 BC. The relic of these ancient decisions is the remnant of "Sabbath" as the name for the Sabbath day surviving in European and non-European tongues nearly universally. It only is not followed in English-German languages which still call it Saturn's Day, as decreed in the 300s by Constantine. Jesus himself abided by these decisions on when and how to observe Sabbath. Thus, we have no basis to reject what Jesus accepted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 18pt;">Sabbath: Is It The 12 Hours From Sunrise Saturday to Sunset?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">By the way, it was apparently a late oral tradition in Judaism as a hedge around the Law to start Sabbath rest on the prior evening of Friday. However, the meaning of "Day" in Gen. 1:5 was the <strong>daylight portion</strong> from sunrise to sunset, and "night" was from sunset to sunrise. Hence, true Sabbath Day rest <strong>begins Saturday morning, and ends Saturday at dusk</strong>. For an excellent article on this at a website dedicated to this issue, see 12 Hour Sabbath 2018 - <a href="https://airtable.com/shrHcky3D6DKBnqOU">PDF from Wayback machine</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Importantly, the author explains that Lev. 23:32 is not support for including the prior evening in the weekly Sabbath rest. That verse instead addresses the Day of Atonement, and how it is measured. <em>Id. </em>The 12 hour weekly sabbath is at <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus+23%3A3&amp;version=NIV">23:3 </a>but the annual 24 hour sabbath for the Day of Atonement is in 23:32 which takes in parts of 2 days, and all of one night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In agreement, please note that Bingham (quoted above) mentioned that the early Christians rested on "Saturday." There is nothing about adding Friday night to the Sabbath rest. Hence, history confirms Sabbath is Saturday only. And Gen. 1:5 proves this means the daylight period</span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 18pt;">A Holy Assembly / Holy Convocation: Is Church-Assembly or Private "Holy" Rest Required?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The Sabbath Command in Leviticus (unlike in Exodus 20:8) refers to a holy assembly or in some translations a "holy convocation."</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><sup>3</sup>six days is work done, and in the seventh day [is] a sabbath of rest, a <strong><em>holy convocation [or assembly]</em></strong>&nbsp;ye do no work; it [is] a sabbath to Jehovah [sic: Yahweh] in all your dwellings. (Lev. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus%2023:3&amp;version=YLT">23:3</a>.)(KJV)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Some explain the word meaning at issue as follows: "The original Hebrew word that is translated as 'convocation' is (pronounced)&nbsp;<em>mik-raw</em> means&nbsp;<em>a <strong>called assembly</strong></em>." (Wayne Blank, "<a href="http://www.keyway.ca/htm2004/20040219.htm">Convocation</a>.")</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">But at least two translations are "holy assembly" - NIV, Holman, &nbsp; Cfr. "holy convocation" NASB, ESV, KJV, YLT. See Bible Hub <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-3.htm">link</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Does this mean by our rest we are involved in a holy assembly de facto? Or is this an independent obligation to call a meeting with others on Sabbath? After all, when the command to obey Sabbath is given in Exodus 20:8 and elsewhere, it includes no command about a Holy Convocation / Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul Kroll at Grace Communion Ministries did a thorough article on this issue, and concluded Leviticus 23:3 means that one's rest on Sabbath is one's holy assembly before God. I am&nbsp; not confident of this. But see this<a href="https://www.gci.org/law/sabbath/lev23"> link</a>. His explanation is:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The essence of Sabbath-keeping was physical rest. In&nbsp;</span><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Exodus%2020.8-11" target="_blank" class="rtBibleRef" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #312c75; text-decoration: underline; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;" data-reference="Exodus 20.8-11" data-version="niv" data-purpose="bible-reference">Exodus 20:8-11</a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Deuteronomy%205.12-15" target="_blank" class="rtBibleRef" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #312c75; text-decoration: underline; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;" data-reference="Deuteronomy 5.12-15" data-version="niv" data-purpose="bible-reference">Deuteronomy 5:12-15</a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">, the Sabbath command specifies rest from labor as the way to keep the day &ldquo;holy.&rdquo; There is no mention of going to a worship service each Sabbath. Other passages in the Old Testament also define the Sabbath by rest, </span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><em></em></span></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;not by attendance at worship services. See&nbsp;</span><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Exodus%2031.12-17" target="_blank" class="rtBibleRef" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #312c75; text-decoration: underline; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;" data-reference="Exodus 31.12-17" data-version="niv" data-purpose="bible-reference">Exodus 31:12-17</a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Numbers%2015.32" target="_blank" class="rtBibleRef" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #312c75; text-decoration: underline; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;" data-reference="Numbers 15.32" data-version="niv" data-purpose="bible-reference">Numbers 15:32</a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Nehemiah%2013.15-22" target="_blank" class="rtBibleRef" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #312c75; text-decoration: underline; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;" data-reference="Nehemiah 13.15-22" data-version="niv" data-purpose="bible-reference">Nehemiah 13:15-22</a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Jeremiah%2017.19-27" target="_blank" class="rtBibleRef" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #312c75; text-decoration: underline; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;" data-reference="Jeremiah 17.19-27" data-version="niv" data-purpose="bible-reference">Jeremiah 17:19-27</a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">. The latter two passages, though they refer to Jerusalem, do not mention anything about failure to attend worship services or &ldquo;sacred assemblies,&rdquo; but only work on the Sabbath as a desecration of this day.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul Kroll concludes that therefore Leviticus 23:3 would be anomolous:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">It would be strange, then, to have one phrase in&nbsp;</span><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Leviticus%2023.3" target="_blank" class="rtBibleRef" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #312c75; text-decoration: underline; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;" data-reference="Leviticus 23.3" data-version="niv" data-purpose="bible-reference">Leviticus 23:3</a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;refer to a weekly worship service commanded for all Israel, and then claim that this was just as important as resting as a way to keep the Sabbath. It would be a mistake to assume such a teaching from a single and vague phrase in one verse when the entire witness of the Old Testament does not mention worship service attendance in conjunction with the Sabbath.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul Kroll then concludes that one's rest was one's sacred assembly -- the rest itself is a form of assembly:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em 30px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Let us look at&nbsp;<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Leviticus%2023.3" target="_blank" class="rtBibleRef" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #312c75; text-decoration: underline;" data-reference="Leviticus 23.3" data-version="niv" data-purpose="bible-reference">Leviticus 23:3</a>&nbsp;directly: &ldquo;There are six days when you may work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of&nbsp;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">rest,</em>&nbsp;a day of sacred assembly. You are&nbsp;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">not to do any work;</em>wherever you live, it is a Sabbath to the Lord.&rdquo; The verse emphasizes&nbsp;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">rest</em>.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em 30px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Since the passage is about resting and not working, it seems that the expression &ldquo;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">day</em>&nbsp;of sacred assembly&rdquo; is a parallel to &ldquo;Sabbath to the Lord&rdquo; and refers not so much to official communal worship on the Sabbath but to the&nbsp;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">day&nbsp;</em>itself as being a &ldquo;sacred assembly.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em 30px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The phrase &ldquo;day of sacred assembly&rdquo; can be understood as a &ldquo;sacred day of celebration&rdquo; or a &ldquo;sacred occasion,&rdquo; as well as a &ldquo;sacred assembly&rdquo; or convocation. The weekly Sabbath, as well as the annual festivals, were occasions to worship and praise God for the abundance of his physical blessings and for saving Israel from bondage in Egypt. But this worship and praise could be given to God in the Israelites&rsquo; participation in rest itself (thus experiencing the blessings of Yahweh through rest), as well as in contemplation and conversation&nbsp;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">at home.</em></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em 30px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">By resting from their labor and self-interests on the weekly Sabbath, the Israelites were presenting themselves before God through rest. Resting was a way of being in the presence of God and fulfilling his sacred purpose. The only people who were commanded to come to the Temple for worship were the Levites and priests. On behalf of the entire nation, they performed the prescribed ceremonies. There was no command for people to watch them, or for them to teach the people. It was simply not possible for very many people to be there.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">My instincts tell me this is possibly correct but at the same time that congregating on Sabbath is permissible and probably advisable.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">First, we should not put a burden from the Law on people without very good reason. The fact that the majority of times the Sabbath command is given -- six times -- without the command of a "holy assembly" -- suggests to me that it is simply synonymous with the concept of rest on Sabbath.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Second, even so, the term "holy assembly" still has meaning for your rest time. You should not use your rest for any unholy activity. It is sacred time. This could support that "holy assembly" means your rest time.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Regardless, to be <strong>safe</strong> in this regard, my recommendation is you make it your custom to have church on Saturday, <em>i.e.</em>,&nbsp;Sabbath. </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The first reason is: why not? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Second, better safe than sorry -- the theory behind 'hedges' around the Law makes perfect sense in this regard. Finally, Jesus "made it his custom" to<em> <strong>attend Scripture readings on Sabbath in the synagogue</strong></em> (Luke 4:14-16), so He found it worthwhile. Why shouldn't we do so too? </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I currently attend church on Saturday, so this removes the concern for me over whether Mr. Kroll is correct or not. I suggest others do likewise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;">What If A Sacred Meeting Is Meant Instead?</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Assuming a holy convocation in Leviticus 23:3 means an assembled "meeting," and is not synonymous with one's "rest", what does it mean? One commentator says it is simple:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">"We should meet and worship with others." ("<a href="http://www.godssabbathtruth.com/sabbath-keeping.html">How do we keep the Sabbath</a>.")</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I would say a "meeting" is more. Jesus says "where <strong>two or three</strong> are gathered in my name, there I am in the midst of them." (Matt. 18:20</span>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Where would this be? Jesus said the Temple would soon be no more, and "God is a spirit" (who can be anywhere in Spirit), and God then wants a particular kind of worshipper rather than a place of worship:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><sup>21</sup>Jesus saith to her, `Woman, believe me, that there doth come an hour, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><sup>22</sup>ye worship what ye have not known; we worship what we have known, because the salvation is of the Jews;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><sup>23</sup>but, there cometh an hour, and it now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father also doth seek such to worship him;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><sup>24</sup><strong>God [is] a Spirit</strong>, and those worshipping Him,<strong> in spirit and truth</strong> it doth behove to worship.' (John <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%204:21-24&amp;version=YLT">4:21-24</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Thus, once the Temple would be gone, a meeting with other believers<strong> would be at least 2 persons meeting in God's name to pray and worship</strong>. Anywhere. God is a Spirit, and can be with us even in a small assembly anywhere. After the Temple would be gone, there is no applicable regulation as to a place or duration or even an order of worship. The early church predominantly met in open <strong>fields or in homes</strong>. See our page "<a href="/recommendedreading/101-jesus-on-church-structure.html">Church Structure</a>." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Furthermore, there is no command to meet with as many people as possible. A meeting in your home with your spouse / children / a friend complies with the Sabbath command, if it truly means a meeting, now that the Temple is gone. As long as you are truly worshipping God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">What if you live where you can find no other believers? How do you comply with a meeting requirement, if truly present? &nbsp;I believe that Jesus taught even when you are one by yourself and pray in secret, that the Father still hears and still answers. (Matt 6:6, pray in secret, and the Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.) Also, in the Original Gospel of Matthew reconstructed by Rives, we read the Hebrew Matthew originally had a slight but important reference to one who is alone:&nbsp; "<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Wherever there are two, they are not without God. And <strong>wherever there is one alone, I say I am with him</strong>." (Matt 18:20, <a href="/images/stories/JWOBook/ogm2012.htm">OGM</a>.)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hence, if you alone are worshipping in Jesus&rsquo; presence &mdash; calling Yahshua to come be with you, is that a holy meeting? I don't see why not. Of course, I would recommend a convocation of at least one other as your aim. This can be with your spouse or child, as long as you pray in spirit and truth, and worship God YHWH with praise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Incidentally, there is no barrier to also worshipping on Sunday. You can do that too. God never says "no" to more time with us. We can celebrate this as the day of Jesus / Yahshua's resurrection</span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">What is Worship?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Assuming again that Sabbath is not just rest, but a day of worship in a meeting, how do we do worship? This answer can apply to the Lord's Day instead or in addition, depending on what the Holy Spirit has taught you is the answer regarding Leviticus 23:3.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus with His disciples went away to quiet outdoor places to <strong>pray</strong> and <strong>sing psalms</strong>. Jesus in praying often fell on His face -- meaning prostrating himself on the ground. He prayed to the Father in the hearing of His disciples, but apparently it was a private personal prayer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">What should we do? Should we follow Jesus' example?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Ron Owens in an article "<a href="http://www.graceonlinelibrary.org/articles/full.asp?id=25|58|343">Worship Service: A Hindrance or a Highway for Revival</a>" explains what is Biblical worship and that we are not practicing it by-and-large:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The primary word used in the Old Testament for worship is the Hebrew word&nbsp;<em>shachah</em>. In each of its 170 uses, it has the same meaning: to <strong>prostrate oneself, to bow down or stoop</strong>. In the New Testament, the Greek word for worship, proskuneo, has virtually the same meaning: <strong>to crouch, prostrate oneself, to kiss the hand, do reverence, to adore</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Examples from Scripture reveal</span>:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And Abram <strong>fell on his face</strong>: and God talked with him, saying, (Genesis 17:3)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And <strong>I bowed down my head</strong>, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son. (Genesis 24:48)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And he said, Nay; but [as] captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua<strong> fell on his face to the earth, and did worship</strong>, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant? (Joshua 5:14)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and<strong> they fell upon their faces</strong>: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them. (Numbers 20:6)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Come, let us <strong>bow down in worship, let us kneel</strong> before the LORD our Maker; (Psalms 95:6)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and <strong>fell before the throne on their faces</strong>, and worshipped God, Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. (Revelations 7:11-12)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And he went a little further, and <strong>fell on his face</strong>, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou [wilt]. (Matthew 26:39)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Ironically, worship is<strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"> never done that way</span> </strong>in any modern church or assembly:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Today, we see very little of this attitude of stooping, of humbling oneself in worship. Instead, it seems the church is spending an inordinate amount of time <strong>standing and celebrating</strong>. (Ron Owens,&nbsp;<em>id.</em>)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In private worship, I suggest you kneel and even bow your head or body forward during prayer. If the church you attend does not actually worship God except by the gesture of words, God already said 'they worship me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.' So perhaps you should find a church that does worship God in a truer sense -- bowing one's head or by prostrating yourself while praying. So perhaps start worshipping in your own home where you have no one restricting your worship. There is no rule it must take place in a hall called 'church.' See our article on "<a href="/recommendedreading/101-jesus-on-church-structure.html">Jesus' Words on Church Structure</a>."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And if you wish some psalms (songs) to sing, there are some contemporary songs that are great. I collect my recommendations at this<a href="/recommendedreading/401-music-store-manager.html"> list-link</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">A Meditation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Here is a Sabbath meditation where God attaches a promise to a Sabbath rest focused upon Him:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"If thou turn away thy foot [on] the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure...not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: [that]<strong> thou shalt delight in&nbsp;Yahweh</strong>...I will make thee to <strong>ride upon the high places</strong> of the earth; and <strong>I will feed thee</strong> with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of Yahweh hath spoken it." (Isaiah 58:13-14.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Also, remember this verse:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace,<strong> whose mind is stayed on thee</strong>; because he trusteth in thee. (Isaiah <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah%2026:3&amp;version=ASV">26:3</a>.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Do Good On The Sabbath!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Follow Jesus' example and do good on the sabbath. Perhaps do a mitzvot &nbsp;-- a good deed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Justin Martyr in 165 AD wrote in <em>First Apology</em> that weekly, "we remind each other of his duty, and <strong>the rich relieve the poor, and upon such charitable accounts we visit some or other every day</strong>." (<em>First Apology</em> LXXXVI at page <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/firstapologyofju00just">91</a>.) "But the wealthy and the willing, for everyone is at liberty to contribute as they think fitting, [make a collection], and this collection is deposited with the bishop, and out of this<strong> he relieves the widow and the orphan</strong>, and such as are reduced to want, by sickness or any other cause, and such as are in bonds, and strangers that come from afar...." <em>Id.</em>, at 94.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In conformance with Jesus's commands and the example of the early church, on each sabbath perhaps send a donation to orphans if not visit and care for them in your personal ministry. (I have no affiliation with any of the organizations I recommend below.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">A most deserving ministry is Jessica Clarke, a young lady who over the past year has been ministering to poor orphans in Kenya and was doing ministry in Israel. You can send a gift at this link:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paypal.me/jessicajclarke">paypal.me payment</a>&nbsp;. Jessica lives at subsistence, so all your contributions will help her serve others. She is an enthusiast of the Jesus' Words Only principle. Presently (June 2020) she is in Jordan due to the Covid-19 lockdowns, but she will be back ministering soon in Israel, God-willing.</span><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; background-color: transparent;"></span><span style="font-size: 18pt; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Also consider helping widows directly whom you know. In the world, as of July 2010, there are estimated to be over 115 million women living in devastating poverty as a result of becoming widows. See this <a href="http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/archive/2010/06/more-than-115-million-widows-living-in-poverty">link</a>.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;">Tips on Celebrating Sabbath</span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">A <a href="http://urj.org/holidays/shabbat/celebrate/"><span style="color: #000000;">Jewish website</span></a> gives you some tips on Shabbat worship, and books to purchase as guides. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #000000;">Certain Sabbath traditions among the Jews are good for us to utilize to remind us of its meaning. For example, the lighting of the candles reminds us of when God said "let there be light." So here is a Jewish <a href="http://www.reformjudaism.org/shabbat-home-ritual"><span style="color: #000000;">webpage</span></a> explaining that morning ritual on Sabbath. It then discusses the Sabbath ritual of sanctifying the day over a glass of wine. And the importance of sharing bread among your family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Then there is the conclusion of Sabbath as night comes on the Sabbath day (daylight hours). The blessings and ritual that Jews follow can enrich our spiritual experience by copying are at this <a href="http://www.reformjudaism.org/practice/prayers-blessings/shabbat-conclusion-worship-services-hinei-el-praising-god">link</a>. These are called&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Havdallah blessings which are two: a praise of God and blessings over the food and wine to prepare for dinner.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jews typically begin Sabbath observance on Friday night -- which I believe began as a hedge around the Law rather than a principle of the Law about the duration of Sabbath. (I contend the Sabbath "day" is the daylight portion of what we call Saturday.) This is a good hedge. We can be mindful of Friday night to rest then too, from a valid hedging purpose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">On Friday night are blessings. They are usually spoken in Hebrew, which you can try to speak. You can listen or participate karaoke style with them with versions of the blessings online. Here is<a href="http://www.reformjudaism.org/practice/prayers-blessings/shabbat-evening-blessings-introductory-lines-kiddush"> one link</a> and here is<a href="http://urj.org/holidays/shabbat/blessings/"> </a><a href="http://www.reformjudaism.org/shabbat-blessings">another link</a><a href="http://urj.org/holidays/shabbat/blessings/"> </a>&nbsp;-- the files are playable in Mp3 and downloadable as well. If you press "Printable version," it gives you the English equivalent to read yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Incidentally, on the same page is a basic blessing of God to use when you thank God for the bread we eat</span>:</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus Did Not Abolish Sabbath</span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Some try to argue Jesus Himself violated Sabbath, and thus showed He abolished it. Rather, Jesus simply violated man-made rules about the Sabbath, and then used astonishment about this as a teaching moment of how to&nbsp;validly apply the Sabbath command. The article &ldquo;Sabbath&rdquo; in <em>&nbsp;</em><strong>Anchor Bible Dictionary</strong> (ed. David N. Freedman) Vol. 5 &nbsp;at 855-56<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><em>&nbsp;</em>explains:</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&ldquo;At times Jesus is interpreted to have abrogated or suspended the Sabbath commandment on the basis of controversies brought about by Sabbath healings and other acts. Careful analysis of the respective passages does not seem to give credence to this interpretation. The action of plucking ears of grain on the Sabbath by the disciples is particularly important in this matter. Jesus makes a foundational pronouncement...'The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath&rsquo; (Mark 2:27). The disciples&rsquo; act of plucking grain <strong>infringed against the rabbinic halakhah of minute casuistry</strong> in which it was forbidden to reap, thresh, winnow, and grind on the Sabbath....<strong>Jesus reforms the Sabbath and restores it to its rightful place as designed in creation</strong>, where the Sabbath is made for all mankind and not specifically for Israel, as claimed by normative Judaism....&rdquo;</span></span></p>

Also, Leviticus 23:15 would be incompatible with resetting the 7 day Sabbath each month by the new moon because this passage mandates 7 weeks of Sabbath's plus 1 "morrow" to count to Pentecost, but new moons would not equal 49 days in 7 cycles of a sabbath reset by new moons. Also, Jesus abided by the Jewish Sabbath cycle, which was not reset each month by the full moon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #008000;">1. Food Preparation on Sabbath?</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">No food preparation of baking or boiling (Exodus 16:23; 35:3) should be done on Sabbath. The prior day, as a result, is known as the Day of Preparation. All foods requiring baking or boiling are prepared therefore on Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Is this no longer an issue in our era of instant heat on a stove or microwave? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">It is true that baking or boiling in the era of Exodus would require building a fire which was a laborious task quite unlike that of our typical modern life. Because Sabbath means "rest day," it is likely not prohibiting non-laborious tasks. Hence, arguably cooking using modern non-laborious means could be as work-free as simply laying out a table and entrees for eating stored food in the past. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">On the other hand, even baking / boiling by electronic means may have&nbsp; other steps that are laborious, such as picking up heavy pots of water, mixing and kneeding ingredients to bake bread, etc. Hence, baking or boiling are just two narrow types of cooking that should be avoided on Sabbath regardless of modern conveniences. Food preparations other than baking or boiling, such as cutting up a salad or bread, are not prohibited.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The best way to avoid any issue is to make your food preparation on Friday, the night before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">God exemplified such food preparation in the desert experience of Israel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">When God provided manna in the desert, He sent <strong>a double portion</strong> on Friday, but on Saturday (Sabbath), nothing. Exodus 16:35. Why? This way we would see God did not make food on Sabbath. God also meant to show us an example how he recommends we store up double on the day before Sabbath. God is a Great Father and teacher.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">There were special exceptions on high holy Sabbaths. For Exodus 12:16 says on a high holy Sabbath -- each of the four annual national feasts -- some work on such a Sabbath to prepare food is allowed so "that all may eat."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">As a result of these laws and commands, by Jesus' day, Friday was often simply called the Day of Preparation. Be careful in not exaggerating that fact. For even a day before a High Holy Day Sabbath was called a "Day of Preparation" because most preparations with the exceptions allowed in Exodus 12:16 had to be completed on the day prior to the high Holy Day Sabbath. This is why on Tuesday of Passion Week, there was a day of preparation before the High Holy Day of Passover which was Wednesday that week, by my calculations. See John 19:31; Mark 15:42.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>End-Times Prophecy and Sabbath</strong>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The pope in 2020 announced a March 14, 2020 convocation at Rome to create a new order based upon "humanism." In his recent book, the <strong>pope suggested</strong> to the world that <em>Sunday</em>, not the "Jewish Sabbath," should be the<strong> universal day of rest by law</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The YouTube channel Bible Flock Box presents the pope's video invitation, and makes comments. Bible Flock Box contends that Sun-day worship if universally imposed can match the prophecy of the book of Revelation about the "mark of the beast." I am not sure that is so, but this pope's invitation sounds like something in the book of Revelation. It does seem that making the world's universal rest on Sun-day would be a mark of a pagan god on us. It goes all the way back to Sol Invictus. Constantine wanted Roman Christians to worship this figure using a thin veneer of&nbsp; Christ's image couched in belief in the facts in the Nicene creed about Jesus' death and resurrection.</span></p>
