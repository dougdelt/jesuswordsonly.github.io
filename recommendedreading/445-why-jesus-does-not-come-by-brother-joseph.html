<h1><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Why Jesus Does Not Come by Brother Joseph [translated from Spanish][2012]</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;" data-mce-mark="1"></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;" data-mce-mark="1">Generation after generation arrives announcing that Jesus is coming soon, but like the previous one, every generation of believers who come, have to leave this world without being able to see the realization of what was expected, since Jesus has not returned. What about us? What's left for us? Will we be another generation who will repeat the same message, and always with the same lack of results? Or is there something we can do to make &nbsp;possible Jesus' return this time?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;" data-mce-mark="1">Probably one can not say much more than that almost all signals before his coming are fulfilled. I mean signals as world wars, generalized epidemics, global economic crises, earthquakes, frequent, etc. But do not forget that these signs would mark only the 'beginning' of the end: "All these are the beginning of sorrows" (Matthew 24:8). However the Master emphasized that the most important of all signals as it would be the last, that would precede His Second Coming: "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come "(Matthew 24:14).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Of course, for many this signal has already been fulfilled because thanks to the proliferation of mass media such as radio, television, telephony, the Internet and social networks, if there has been any generation in which the gospel has been preached in every nation of the world, this has been that generation. But then why does Jesus &nbsp;not return? If we look closely at the prophecy, discover the reason. Jesus said, "Many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many and iniquity shall abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom in the whole world shall be preached as a testimony to all nations, and then shall the end come "(Matthew 24:11-14).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Let me emphasize a word that appears twice in this prophecy, the word 'this', because it is the key to unlock the mystery. When you say 'this', it is clearly making a distinction between one object and another. No one will ever say, 'I want this product' if it's all there, right? Let us see what Jesus said, to understand what he said. He did not say 'it will be preached <strong>the</strong> Gospel throughout the world, but "<strong>this</strong> gospel of the kingdom throughout the world. " What Jesus was predicting was that the gospel would not &nbsp;become known worldwide until freshly just before his coming. His intention was to identify a point that was not simply preaching '<strong>the</strong> gospel', but instead preaching '<strong>this</strong> gospel of the kingdom'. What he was announcing was the last sign before his return would be massive preaching the same gospel of the kingdom which he preached and not another.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;" data-mce-mark="1">&nbsp;But is the gospel being preached in the whole world &nbsp;the same that he taught? Well, if so, Jesus would have cone, right? Will there then 'another' gospel? Let's see. If Jesus said he would not return until "this gospel" was announced gospel which he preached in all the world, then the gospel which is being preached massively so far has to be a gospel 'different' than his and is even why Jesus does not return. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Now the question is: What could be this 'other gospel'? Whereas 'gospel' means 'good news', what might be the virtues of this 'other gospel' that compared to 'the narrow way' would sound like real 'good news' for Christians? It definitely would have to offer a path 'easier' and at the 'least cost' for salvation, something that requires almost no effort on the part of anyone at the same time we are assured entry to heaven no matter what.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;" data-mce-mark="1">To make a proper comparison between this' other 'and the original gospel, we need to know what is' the gospel of the kingdom' announcing Jesus, and the way to find out is: If Jesus said 'this' and' that 'gospel, is because it has to be very close to your last statement, so we should be able to find it immediately before or after the last thing I said, and we see that right in the above verse we find exactly one reference to salvation. The last three words say: "he who endures to the end shall be saved."</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">So the 'gospel of the kingdom' which would be preached in the last few days is nothing less than that to be saved one must be able to endure to the end. And if Jesus referred to it as "this gospel of the kingdom ', it is because that's the same message he preached. What happened then with the gospel from the days when he was announcing?, At what point did it disappear and a different one appear? Where does this 'other' gospel come from and who introduced it into the Church?</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;The proof that 'the gospel of the kingdom' is not yet being preached and has been replaced by one that offers a way 'easier' and at 'least cost' for salvation is the fact that maybe you never heard THAT FOR ANYONE TO BE SAVED, THE MUST ENDURE TO THE END, BUT INSTEAD YOU ARE FAMILIAR with phrases like: 'salvation is only by grace THROUGH FAITH', and 'not of works' etc. This is what is being preached around the world. Is this the same as he taught? Well, if so, Jesus would have cone, right? Will there ever then be 'another' gospel? Let's see. If Jesus said he would not return until the same gospel that he preached was preached to all the world, but which has not happened because there has been massive preaching of a gospel 'different' than his. And that explains why Jesus does not return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Now the question is: What could be this 'other gospel'? Whereas 'gospel' means 'good news', what might be the virtues of this 'other gospel' that compared to 'the narrow way' would sound like real 'good news' for Christians? It definitely would have to offer a path 'easier' and at 'least cost' for salvation, something that requires almost no effort on the part of both anyone at the same time we are assured entry to heaven no matter what.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Section 2: Jesus or Paul?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;" data-mce-mark="1">This subtitle may surprise you, for obvious reasons, because at first glance, it is assumed that Jesus the son of God, and Paul, who always presented himself as his apostle, preached the same gospel. But these are things one simply assumes but we have never bothered to check if they are really true. Would you dare to join me in a discussion of the teachings of both to see if this subtitle is totally devoid of sense, or if there really was a difference between the teachings of the Savior and, of course, the apostle?</span></p>

How so? Simply listen to pastors and teachers on the radio or on TV to realize that<em><strong> most of his sermons are based almost exclusively on the teachings of Paul and hardly quote Jesus.</strong></em> If you stop and listen, you'll see that whatever the topic you are being taught, almost always the pastors choose to quote Paul's epistles rather than the Gospels. In fact, what is worse, I heard on the radio Integrity &nbsp;programs that they almost never NAMED JESUS but they spent all their time talking about the 'Apostle Paul', as they like to call him: 'Paul said this, Paul said that 'etc ... and Jesus ... Nothing! If you do not believe me, I invite you to do a test for a week and see whether what I say is true.</span><span data-mce-mark="1">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #0000ff;">Section 3: The Same Gospel?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul said he preached 'the gospel of Christ': "I have fulfilled the gospel of Christ." In his letters this phrase appears 10 times: Romans 15:9, 29; 1 Corinthians 9:12, 18; 2 Corinthians 2:12, 9:13; 10:14, Galatians 1:7, Philippians 1:27 and 1 Thessalonians 3: 2.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus announced 'his own gospel' --- &nbsp;'the gospel of the kingdom': "Jesus came ... preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God" (Mark 1:14). He said he had been sent for that: "We need to ... preach the kingdom of God: for therefore am I sent" (Luke 4:43), and that was also what He commanded His apostles to preach: he "sent them to preach the kingdom of God" (Luke 9:2). It should be emphasized that the phrase '<em><strong>gospel of Christ</strong></em>' appears <em><strong>only in Paul's epistles</strong> </em>and it <em><strong>never appears in the rest of the New Testament</strong></em>, and that the phrase '<em><strong>gospel of the kingdo</strong></em>m', of the <em><strong>7 times that it is mentioned throughout the Bible</strong></em>, it <em><strong>never appears in the epistles of Paul.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">But possibly that could represent a mere semantic difference. What matters is the content, right? If what Paul was indeed announcing was 'the gospel of Christ', then his letters should be filled with the Master's words and what was added by Paul should be identical to what Jesus announced. Let us first see whether Paul's letters contain or not the words of Jesus Christ and then review whether Paul's message was identical to the son of God.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">If we look at a 'red letter' Bible (where the words of Jesus are printed in red) and review the letters of Paul, we find to our amazement that not in any of his 13 epistles does Paul ever quote JESUS. NEVER. Not one quote! &nbsp;That seems strange. It is hard to believe that what Paul taught was 'the gospel' of Christ when none of his 13 epistles contain any of the words of Him whom he claimed to represent. Now that we discovered that Paul did not quote Jesus in his letters, we can only see whether what Paul taught in regard to salvation was different at least in content from that which Jesus preached. Let us see if what Paul taught that you had to do to be saved is the same as what the Savior taught.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Section 4: Salvation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that to be safe enough to believe that Jesus had risen and confess Him as 'Lord'. Nothing more: "This is the word of faith which we preach: If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation "(Romans 10:8-10).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that to enter the kingdom of heaven it was not enough to call him 'Lord'. Furthermore ONE HAD TO DO THE WILL OF GOD: "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven" (Matthew 7:21) .</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that salvation was a gift that you just received by faith and not something to be achieved by works: "By grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest anyone should boast ... And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it works, then it is more grace: otherwise work is no more work "(Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 11:6).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that it was up to us 'buy' or 'win' our souls enduring to the end: "By your perseverance you will secure your lives" (Luke 21:19 RSV). 'Will save' was used to translate the Greek word 'ktáomai' which means 'buy' or 'win'.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that salvation is by pure grace and it is received in a free and undeserved manner: "Being justified freely by his grace" (Romans 3:24).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that you must be worthy of salvation: "Watch therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy ... to stand before the Son of Man .... He who does not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me "(Luke 20:35, Matthew 10:38).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that once we have believed and confessed the risen Jesus as' Lord 'that we were saved, resurrected and glorified because "once saved, always saved':" He raised us up and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus "( Ephesians 2:6).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that you will rise to resurrection and be able to sit with him in his throne only upon the condtion that you overcome first: &nbsp;"so you shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead ... He who overcomes, I will grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne "(Luke 21:36, Revelation 3:21).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that one was justified only by believing "in him who has justified everyone who believes .... And that by the Law no one is justified before God, is evident: for, 'The just shall live by faith'" (Acts 13:39; Galatians 3:11). (Note: Paul used a mistranslation of Habakkuk 2:4. What it says in Hebrew is' emunah 'which means' loyalty' and 'faith': "The just shall live by his faithfulness' no 'by faith'. Bible People of God.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that one is justified by repentance and confession: "Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector... [and] the tax collector stood at a distance, not even daring to raise his eyes to heaven, but he beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me a sinner!' I assure you that the latter returned to his house justified, but not the first "(Luke 18:10-14).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that to be saved you did not have to do anything other than believe: "that does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness" (Romans 4:4-5).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;Jesus taught that to be saved HAD to struggle and persevere, "Lord, are there few that be saved? ... Jesus replied: "Strive to enter through the narrow door ... He who endures to the end shall be saved "(Luke 13:23-24, Matthew 24:13).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that faith and works are opposite and mutually incompatible, forcing us to take ONLY ONE of either such approaches to be saved: "For if those who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise ... man is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ "(Romans 4:14, Galatians 2:16).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that both faith and works are necessary for salvation, and that faith and obedience to the commandments are not enemies, but they both go hand in hand: "He that believeth on me hath everlasting life" (John 6 47), and "Whoever keeps my word will never see death" (John 8:51). In the book of Revelation, also known as "The revelation of Jesus Christ" (Revelation 1:1), it tells us that 'the saints' are "those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12) .</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that to be saved it was not necessary to satisfy the law of God: "Knowing that a man is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, to be justified by faith of Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no flesh be justified "(Galatians 2:16).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that to be saved was to fulfill God's law: "a certain lawyer stood up and said ... Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He asked: 'What is written in the law? ... Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself ... do this, and live "(Luke 10:25-28). "Then one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing must I do to have eternal life? He said ... if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments "(Matthew 19:16-17).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul taught that on the cross Jesus had abolished and voided the law: "... abolishing in his flesh the law of commandments contained in ordinances ... canceling the record of debt ... putting it out of the way, nailing it to the cross" (Ephesians 2: 15, Colossians 2:14).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that He came not to abolish or repeal the law, but the opposite: "... I have not come to abolish the Law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill" (Matthew 5:17).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that the law was in effect only until the death of Jesus on the cross: "what good is the Law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come (Jesus) ... Before faith came, we were kept under the law ... The law was our tutor (teacher) to bring us to Christ ... But after faith, we are not under a tutor ... because the goal of the law is Christ "(Galatians 3:19, 23, 25, Romans 10:4).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that the law would remain in force until the heavens and the earth pass away in the day of judgment: "Truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass, not one jot or one tittle will pass from the law till all be fulfilled "(Matthew 5:18).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that those who try to obey the commands are under the curse: "All who rely on observing the law are under a curse" (Galatians 3:10).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that one is blessed to obey and not to break the commandments: "If you know these things, blessed are you if you do ... Why do you break the command of God?" (John 13:17, Matthew 15 : 3).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that once saved, always saved even if one was later taken in a life of sin: "... you hear that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one woman has his father ... To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of Christ Jesus "(1 Corinthians 5:1, 5).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that those believers who do not repent or will correct themselves will not be saved, but that they would be cast into hell fire: "woe to that man by whom the offense cometh! So if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from thee: it is better for thee with one eye to enter into life, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire "(Matthew 18:7-9).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that the fire would destroy the works of the disobedient Christians and not Christians themselves. In other words, they would lose only their rewards but NOT their salvation: "the work of each will be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire, and the work of each man's, the fire shall try. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved, yet so as through fire "(1 Corinthians 3:13-15).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that believers who remain in sin who would not cast away sin would lose not only rewards, but also their salvation, and so the fire will destroy TRUE BRANCHES: "I am the vine, ye are the branches ... Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away ... He who does not remain in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered, and men gather them, and cast them into the fire and they are burned "(John 15:1-6).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that at the second coming of Jesus ALL BELIEVERS would be brought to the Lord, and "all shall be changed ... The dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed ... we say that at the word of the Lord ... the Lord shall descend from heaven ... And the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord "(1 Cor 15:51-52, 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17) .</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that His coming not all believers would be taken with him: "I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed, the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two women will be grinding together: the one will be taken and the other left. Two will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left "(Luke 17:34-36).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Section 5: Two Gospels</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">What do you say now? Could the gospel Paul preached come to be called "the gospel of Christ '? Of course not. Such marked differences exist between what Paul taught and what Jesus taught about salvation, it has become clear that what Paul preached was his own gospel, not that of Jesus Christ. Interestingly, in his letters the phrase "<em><strong>my gospel</strong></em>" appears 3 times: (Romans 2:16, 16:25, 2 Timothy 2:8) and "<em><strong>our gospel</strong></em>" also appears 3 times: (2 Corinthians 4:3, 1 Thessalonians 1:5 and 2Tesalonisenses 2:14). In the rest of the New Testament, there never appears the phrases 'my gospel' and 'our gospel.' They are only found in Paul's epistles.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">It becomes clear that in preaching a 'gospel,' Paul tried to justify saying that his proclaimed Gospel had been revealed to him directly by Jesus Christ in a personal way, "the gospel preached by me is not after man, for I neither received nor learned from man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ "(Galatians 1:11-12), which begs the question: Could it be that after his resurrection Jesus changed the Gospel and decided to not tell any of his 12 apostles but instead have Paul exclusively reveal it?</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Would all the earthly ministry of the Son of God be aimed to preach a message that only would serve to be in effect for a few years, and then be replaced by a new one? Will the earlier recipients rise from the dead after Jesus supposedly amended the requirements for salvation and created a new gospel?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Or did Paul borrow the name of the Son of God (which incidentally is not 'Christ 'but' Jesus'), and use it to authenticate a message absolutely opposite of what the Savior preached and thus was a fake and a fraud? The answer is obvious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus said, "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words shall not pass away" (Matthew 24:35). The words of Jesus are eternal and unchanging.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Another reason that Paul gave to justify the obvious differences between his message and the apostles of Jesus was that his gospel was only for the Gentiles: "... I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter [was for] the circumcised ... that [which] worked through Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised worked also in me toward the Gentiles ... that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised "(Galatians 2:7-9). However, using this excuse, Paul unwittingly confirms what we have been saying all along: that there are two different gospels!</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">With this I am not saying that both are legitimate. As far as we know, Jesus never preached a gospel to the Jews and a different one to the Gentiles, but said the same gospel of the kingdom was to be brought by the apostles ALL NATIONS " before governors and kings will be brought for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles ... Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature ... go and make disciples of all nations ... when it comes on you the Holy Spirit ... you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem ... and to the ends of the earth "(Mark 10:18, 16:15, Matthew 28:19-20, Acts 1:8).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Also note that the apostle John saw "flying through the midst of heaven another angel, having the everlasting gospel to preach ... to every nation, kindred, tongue and people ... Here is the patience of the saints who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus "(Revelation 14:1-2). What does this mean?, There is only one legitimate gospel, which is for Jews and Gentiles alike and consists in keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. So it was not Jesus who changed the gospel! It was Paul! There is only one genuine gospel, that of Jesus. The other is a fraud! What Paul preached was not 'the gospel of Christ' ... it was the gospel of 'PAUL.'</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">The amazing thing about this wonderful prophecy from Matthew about the end is that it not only announces that the 'gospel of the kingdom that Jesus preached would be announced just before the return of the Lord but massively, and that after his departure there would appear a different message directed exclusively to believers, even revealing what the content of that message and what its consequences. If you do not believe me, then please take note: The prophecy says that "many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world ... "</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">You see that Jesus was talking about what would happen in the last days in the church and not in the world. I'll add the word 'Christian' in brackets within the verse to understand its meaning. The prophecy would read: "Many false prophets (Christians) will appear and deceive many people (Christians), and the increase of wickedness, the love of many (Christians) will cool. But the (Christian) who endures to the end will (Christian) will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world ... " It is clear that this prophecy can not be applied to people of the world for how it would read 'the unbeliever who endures to the end shall be saved'? Obviously, it is speaking of believers.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">So if Jesus said that only he who endures to the end, 'this' will be saved, is making a distinction again implying that there are others who are not going to be saved. The saved are obviously those that endure to the end. But why should a believer might think that your salvation depends on your perseverance? Simply because they were taught this. Considering that there are millions of Christians today who think that salvation does not depend on one's perseverance in faith but it is only by the grace of God and not by works, and that you simply confess Jesus as Lord and believe that God raised him from the dead and one is already saved, ask: is not this a fulfillment of what Jesus predicted that "false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many"?</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Section 6: False Prophet?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Recognizing then that millions of believers have been led to believe mistakenly that in taking the gospel of 'the &nbsp;gift' of Paul that they have accepted the true message of Jesus and that they are already saved, could we describe Paul as a 'false prophet'? I understand it may sound surprising to say something like that about Paul? Isn't he the great apostle? Could he be a false prophet?' It is precisely because of preconceptions and misconceptions that false prophets have always been rigged to benefit from the beginning. A false prophet does not just come to cause damage from the outside. It can come from the inside, from one who has walked in obedience to God, but at some point in his gait has fallen into the rebellion and disobedience, and without having repented he has continued preaching and teaching even when outside the will of God. Such a one ends up inevitably becoming a false prophet in the Church, justifying his own sin and not only deceives others but also teaches them to do the same.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">In other words, a false prophet is not necessarily one that started badly, but one that ends badly. A good example of someone who, having started well ended up as a false prophet was Balaam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit he even prophesied the coming of the Messiah, "the Spirit of God came upon him ... and said ... I see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and there shall stand a scepter of Israel "(Numbers 24:17), but later succumbed to greed and went astray, and as he failed to repent or correct himself, Balaam ended up causing more harm than good to the people of God. He was a good example of someone who started well but ended badly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Is this the same thing that happened to Paul? Did Paul ever disobey? Ever getting out of the will of God? And if so, did he recognize it, repent from it, and confess it, or did he do nothing about this and continued to preach and teach the same? The Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit had strictly forbidden him to travel to Jerusalem: "... the disciples told Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem" (Acts 21:4). But what did he do? HE TRAVELED TO JERUSALEM! He disobeyed the Holy Spirit and was completely out of the will of God! But who has not ever gone off &nbsp;and disobeyed God's will? He who is without sin cast the first stone. The important thing is if you repented and corrected, right?</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">The sad and unfortunate that in the New Testament there is no record of Paul having ever confessed his sin but quite the opposite! Paul was justifying himself to end. Watch as he presented himself later in his letters: "I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles" (Ephesians 3:1). But was Paul a 'prisoner of Christ' or a prisoner of his own stubbornness, and did he go to jail because he was trying to 'save the Gentiles' or was that just an excuse? Paul was not a 'prisoner of Christ Jesus' for the simple reason that it was not Jesus Christ who sent him to Jerusalem, and he was not arrested because of the Gentiles as He could not be travelling to Jerusalem to convert Gentiles because there he would find [mostly] Jews. Paul is then another good example of someone who disobeyed and went out of the will of God, but never repented and confessed his sin but was justifying himself and he continued talking, writing letters and teaching the Church. That explains how he came to deviate so much that he eventually produced a completely different gospel.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Now, do not get me wrong. The name 'false' is not in order to denigrate the person. Then what is it that makes a person a false prophet? Not the person itself, BUT YOUR MESSAGE! A false prophet is one who 'distorts' the original message, which distorts the Scriptures to their own convenience. And didn't Paul misrepresent the Scriptures? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">I'll give a couple of examples: First, this is what Paul said: "Even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted for righteousness" (Galatians 3:6). This is what Paul did not consider: "... I know that he will command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him "(Genesis 18:19). Nor had Paul considered this one: "I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham your father ... because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and My laws" (Genesis 26:3). Paul hid information that would be detrimental to sell his 'gospel of the free gift.'&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">And <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">about Paul's claim</span> that Abram "believed God, and it was counted for righteousness," Paul's doctrine is based on a mistranslation. The <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">correct translation</span> would be "believed the Lord, and counted it to Him as righteousness" See the version 'Spanish Sagradas Escrituras Scriptures' <a href="http://bibledbdata.org/onlinebibles/spanish_sev/01_015.htm">Gen. 15:6</a> - [<span style="color: #00008b; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: justify;">15:6 Y creyó al SEÑOR, y se lo contó por justicia."</span>&nbsp;[See also Reina Valera (1960) <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=G%C3%A9nesis+15&amp;version=RVR1960">Gen. 15:6</a>&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000; line-height: normal;">Y creyó a Jehová, y le fue contado por justicia]&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">In the <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">true version of Gen. 15:6</span>, Abram counts as an act of justice that God confirmed his promise to give him offspring. It was not about God justifying Abram because Abram had believed. The proof is that before that time Abram still would not have been 'justified' for not having believed in God, right? But then how do you explain this: "By faith Abraham, when called, obeyed by going out to the place which he should after received for an inheritance ... by faith he sojourned in the land of promise" (Hebrews 11:8-9). Abram thus had believed God long before <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">the events recorded in Gen 15:6</span>. If the justification was for having believed in God, how was it that God had not justified Abram before <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">when Abram already believed</span>?</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">And second, this is what Paul says "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one" (Romans 3:10), supposedly quoting Psalm 14:3. This is what Paul did not consider, "God is in the generation of the righteous" (Psalm 14:5). Only two verses below, the words present shows that there are the just, and not just one, but an entire generation! So the same Psalm says NO to <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">the proposition</span>: "None is righteous," but "there is none who does good." What the Psalmist is saying is that among the fools who say in your heart: "There is no God" there is none who does good. So <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Paul</span> definitely 'misrepresented' the message translated or rather Paul 'reinterpreted' certain scriptures and presented only the parts that suited him and hid the others.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">What makes it difficult to accept that Paul became a false prophet is that he wrote very good things. However, that's logical because there was a stage in his life when he walked in obedience to God. But then came his apostasy as in his writings you can find instances when even he got to the point of contradicting himself. Besides, no one is saying that 'everything that Paul wrote was wrong', but 'not everything that Paul wrote was fine.' And you may wonder, 'How can Paul be a false prophet if performed many miracles?' But if we believe what Jesus taught: "... there shall arise ... false prophets, and they shall show <em><strong>great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect</strong></em>", we see that the signs do not necessarily endorse the message of a prophet. Jesus warned that if the prophet preaches the message that is different from what previously revealed BY GOD, what these signs and wonders precisely confirm is that this prophet is false!</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">So Jesus warned us not to be detracted or deceived by signs and miracles because the way to judge the legitimacy of a prophet is not their signs, but by their words and by their fruits. In the Parable of the Sheepfold, Jesus told us that we should beware of anyone who delivers a different message than his own: "He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, is a thief and a robber" (John 10:1), and in particular to draw attention to what type of fruit was produced -- their teachings: "Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves ... by their fruits ye shall know "(Matthew 15-16).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">And what have been the fruits of Paul and 'the gospel'? It has come to displace Jesus. In many churches today the main figure is not Jesus but Paul. In sermons today, who else is pointed to more than Paul? And his letters more used instead of the words of Jesus. The 'Christian' songs are full of quotes from Paul, yet contain very few phrases of the Lord Jesus. But what is worse, most Christians have accepted 'the gospel of Paul' instead of 'the gospel of the kingdom'. (Surely, when we compared the teachings of both competing passages above, you often should have been surprised by what belonged to Jesus. &nbsp;Why would that be so? Because surely you knew very well the gospel of Paul, but were not as familiar with what Jesus said you had to do to be saved, or am I wrong?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">What can we say about the fruits of Paul and 'his gospel'? That you, Paul, have done well the work of the false prophet as a 'wolf' wgi steals the sheep and scatters -- "the wolf attacks the flock and scatters" (John 10:12). Well let's face it, hasn't the church been 'split' for centuries by matters of doctrine, especially in regard to salvation? If Paul had not come with a 'different gospel,' we would have all the same doctrine. But as to those who established the canon for what constituted the Bible, they were deceived by him. To make matters worse, we gathered all <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">of these writings</span> into one book (I mean the gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of Paul)! So the Church has been divided. If only we included the teachings of Jesus Christ, we would not have this problem.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus said: "I have other sheep that are not of this fold (Gentiles): them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd" (John 10:16). Oh! If there was only 'one voice' and 'one shepherd' and there is 'one flock' ! &nbsp;But as there are more than one voice, and instead of having one pastor, there are two. As a result, there is NOT ONE FOLD because it has been divided. So here is the solution to the lack of unity of the church. As long as we still prefer to hear imore than one voice, and while we continue to enjoy another pastor apart from Jesus, we can not have unity, and instead there will still be more than one flock. But if we were to have JESUS alone? If we heard only his voice, we would have ONE SHEPHERD and ONE FOLD: "If ye continue in my word, you are truly my disciples" (John 8:31-32).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">And speaking of the fruits of Paul and 'sheep stealing' and 'dividing the flock', remember that he claimed to be "of the tribe of Benjamin" (Philippians 3:5)? It turns out that there is an ancient prophecy that seems to fit perfectly with what have been the fruits of Paul: "Jacob called his sons ... Come together, that I will announce what is going to happen in the future ... Benjamin is a ravening wolf: in the morning he devour the prey, and at the evening he will divide the spoil '(Genesis 49:27 Bible People of God). Here is one of the future descendants of Benjamin described as 'a wolf' at first starting to 'eat' the kill and eventually ends up 'dividing' the spoils. Did not Paul originally started 'devouring' the church when he first persecuted it, and then at the end 'dividing the spoils', when he managed to attract a vast majority of believers in their own 'GOSPEL OF A FREE GIFT' with conditions much easier and comfortable for salvation and pulling them away from the 'gospel of the kingdom' that Jesus preached?</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium; color: #0000ff;">Section 6: False Apostle</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of false prophets who are in "sheep's clothing," how does Paul present himself? In most of the 13 epistles, the first thing you read in addition to their name is the word 'apostle': "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ" (2 Corinthians 2:1). But was Paul actually an "apostle of Jesus Christ"?, Or was that his 'disguise' for believers to accept what he and 'his gospel' represented'? (Remember also he claimed that his gospel was 'the gospel of Jesus Christ' but that was not the case.)</p>
<p><br />Jesus said: "If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true" (John 5:31). Thus, what one can say about himself does not count unless his testimony can be confirmed by two or more people, so the way to find out if Paul was the 'Apostle of Jesus Christ' is according to the Bible rule established by Moses and confirmed by Jesus: "In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word" (Matthew 18:16). Therefore, what we need here are witnesses who can confirm what Paul said, and because he said he was an apostle "of Jesus Christ", what better witness than the Lord Himself should we seek to verify whether or not Paul was 'His Apostle'?</p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Did Jesus ever appoint Paul as 'the Apostle'? The Bible says that Jesus "spent the night praying to God. And ... he called his disciples and chose twelve ... to whom He also named apostles: Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon called the Zealot, Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor "(Luke 6:12-16). Jesus chose twelve, and Paul is not on that list.</span></p>
<p><br />Is it then that after the resurrection Jesus chose him to replace Judas? The Bible says that "in those days Peter ... said ... [to replace Judas] you need [to choose among] these men who have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day He was taken up from us, and thus must become a witness with us of his resurrection. And they put forth [two choices] &nbsp;... Joseph ... and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord ... shows which of these two you have chosen to take ... this ... apostleship from which Judas fell ... And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles " (Acts 1:15-26). Jesus could not have chosen Saul as a replacement for Judas because when Saul was converted, that position was already occupied, and also because the condition for being an apostle was also stated by Jesus: "... in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, <em><strong>you who have followed me</strong></em> will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel "(Matthew 19:28), and Paul never was with Jesus.</p>
<p><br />The only thing that came as far as temporarily calling Paul an 'apostle' Paul (and Barnabas) was by Luke (Acts 14:4, 14), which is understandable since Luke was Paul's disciple, but after climbing to Jerusalem and meeting the real apostles of the Lord, Luke recanted and never again referred to Paul in this way (see Acts 14 and 15). So we do not have any evidence in favor of Paul's apostleship and from the Lord or twelve. However, in the New Testament itself there is evidence against him and many questioned Paul as such: "If to others I am not an apostle ..." (1 Corinthians 9:2) Paul wrote, and "the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb "(Revelation 21:14) said John, a number to which Paul himself admitted he did not belong, saying Jesus:"appeared to the twelve "(1 Corinthians 15:5). The apostles of the Lord then were only twelve, not thirteen.</p>
<p><br />But the most devastating evidence of the false claims of Paul ever showing he was an apostle of Jesus Christ is the witness that the Apostle John received from the Lord himself when Jesus said: "Write ... to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus: I know ... that ... you have tested those who say they are apostles and are not, and hast found them liars "(Revelation 1:11, 2:2). Could Jesus have been referring to "Paul and his companions" (Acts 13:13)? One way to find out is as follows.</p>
<p><br />We know that in the Church there were two sides accusing each other of being false apostles. On one side were those who denied Paul's apostleship: "I am not an apostle to others," and the other was Paul who accuses them of not being apostles: "such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ "(2 Corinthians 11:13). Who was telling the truth and who was lying? The solution to this longstanding controversy is simple. If Jesus welcomed the Church of Ephesus <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">in Asia (modern Turkey)</span>, having examined and approved it ridding itself of those that 'claimed to be apostles but were not', we know that one of these two sides was finally abandoned by believers in Asia, and especially for those of the church at Ephesus. Which of the two sides <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">of competing apostles</span> experienced this <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">loss of Asia</span>? Will those who accused Paul be from Asia? Or does Paul win against <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">those in Asia of which Ephesus was the capital</span>? &nbsp;The answer was given by Paul himself: "Everyone at Ephesus in Asia abandoned me..." (2 Timothy 1:15, 18).</p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">It was there in Ephesus where they made the judgment which the Lord approved in Revelation. It is the same place where Paul was TESTED AND JUDGED BY THE CHURCH. Alexander, a disciple of Ephesus (Acts 19:1, 33) was one of those who testified against him: "Alexander ... did me ... much evil and has greatly withstood our words" (from one who claimed to be an apostle and was not), whose verdict we know from Paul's own pen: "... At my first defense no one stood with me, but all deserted me" (2 Timothy 4:14-16). So when Jesus referred to 'say they are apostles and are not, " Jesus was talking about Paul!</span></p>
<p><br />Therefore, even though in Paul's letters he identified himself as an 'apostle of Jesus Christ', Paul's testimony is not enough to accept it as such and it completely lacks validity because it takes two or more witnesses to support it, much less when the Lord Himself testified exactly the opposite! And if you're thinking what the Lord said to Ananias: "... this is my chosen instrument to carry my name," note that Jesus chose him as 'witness' and not as an 'apostle' or 'teacher', and the reason was not so 'glamorous': "For I will show him how much he must suffer for my name." What Jesus told Paul was: "Why do you persecute me?" And not "why do you not follow me? '(Acts 9:15-16; 4). That was not a call to ministry. This was Jesus' judgment against Saul for having persecuted him and his church!</p>
<p><br />Therefore, aside from the temporary addition of the witness of his faithful friend and follower Luke who later recanted, neither Jesus nor the 12 apostles, nor Ananias nor anyone else ever confirmed Paul's apostleship. The truth is the opposite, for it has become clear that neither was it true that the gospel Paul claimed to be 'the gospel of Christ' was in fact so, nor that Paul was an 'apostle of Jesus Christ.' No wonder Jesus said <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">in Revelation 2 that this figure at Ephesus</span> 'had been found a liar'!</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium; color: #0000ff;">Section 7: The Gospel of the Kindom</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even before he baptized Jesus in the Jordan, John the Baptist announced the arrival of the kingdom: "... John the Baptist came preaching ... and saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matthew 3:1-2). In addition, he announced the savior, and pointed even further to the coming of the Holy Spirit: "One comes after me who is mightier than I ... I have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit" (Mark 1:8) . So did Jesus. He "came ... preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel" (Mark 1:14-15), but he took care to indicate the arrival of the kingdom was due to the presence of the Spirit that was upon him, "If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then you have come to the kingdom of God" (Matthew 12:28).</p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">And why is the kingdom so closely linked to the Holy Spirit? First, because without the Spirit no new birth took place. And without a new birth, there was no entrance into the kingdom of God: "... unless one is born of the Spirit, he can not enter the kingdom of God" (John 3:5). And second, because the kingdom means &nbsp;that men should do the will of God on earth as the angels do so in heaven: "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth "(Matthew 6:10). and that was the main reason that God made the famous 'promise': "... I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and keep My judgments and do them ... and I will save you all your filthiness "(Ezekiel 36:26-29). The coming of the Spirit would be first so we can keep the commandments of God. and second, to empower us to distribute spiritual gifts, evangelize or use the tools to establish the kingdom. The Spirit then is who gives us "power" to do, because the Spirit indwelling of the holy saints." (Daniel 4:18).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">So John 3:16 is not the complete message. "The gospel of the kingdom 'is the entire message, which the apostle Peter summed up so magnificently in what might be called his most inspirational sermon, when the Spirit had just descended upon him: "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is unto you ... and for all who are far off, and for all whom the Lord our God will call "(Acts 2:38-39). Jesus Christ had to come first to do away with sin with his blood, "the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29), precisely to 'clear the way' for the Holy Spirit (because His Holiness does not dwell where sin dwells), so that God might send it to dwell in the hearts of His reborn children. The blood of Jesus is for the forgiveness of sins, but not to live the life of the kingdom. The Holy Spirit had to come to do that.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">But this brings us to the next step. As the son of God, Jesus waited for thirty years for the Spirit to come upon him and anoint him with 'power' to do. As soon as that happened, his first words were in his hometown synagogue: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me ... he has anointed me to preach good news ... heal ... proclaim liberty ...give the blind sight ..." (Luke 4:18), and before leaving this world his last words to the apostles were "tarry in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high" because "you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you" (Luke 24: 49, Acts 1:8). They depended upon the Spirit from start to finish.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">And Jesus not only proved to be 'dependent on the Holy Spirit' from start to finish, but he also taught his disciples: "The Holy Spirit ... will teach you what you should say ... The Holy Spirit ... will teach you all things and will remind everything that I have said ... the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth ... and he will show you things to come "(Luke 12:12, John 14:26, 16:13). So if, after the departure of Jesus, the Holy Spirit was entrusted to the Church to help us do the Father's will, keep us from sin, teach us what to speak, lead us into all truth, remember the words of Jesus, reveal things to come and to receive power, should we not be depending upon the Holy Spirit of the Divine Person?</span></p>
<p><hr /><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Was it not so that his disciples having announced the early arrival of the Spirit ascended into heaven, and immediately after "... while they looked steadfastly toward heaven ... here stood by them two men in white apparel; Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? ... Jesus ... has been taken from you into heaven ... "(Acts 1:9-11)? Like, 'Do not come soon told that the Holy Spirit? Jesus and left! Why do they keep looking at the sky? '' Dependent Holy Spirit '. That was the message! Jesus later said: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" (Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 28, 3:6, 13, 22). Did you know that this is the only commandment in the entire Bible that Jesus gave seven times in a row?, Do not you think is worthy of our highest consideration? Why is not being done then? Because Jesus Himself said that not all 'have heard', and because:</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul taught that we should rely on 'Christ' because he was the one who gave us 'power' to 'power': "I can do everything through Christ who strengthens me ... Christ the power of God ... to rest upon me the power of Christ" (Philippians 4:13; 1Coritios 1:24, 2 Corinthians 12:9).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus taught that we must rely on the Holy Spirit to receive 'power' to 'power': "You will receive power when the Holy Spirit upon you, and you will be my witnesses" (Acts 1:8).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Understanding this, consider the following: "Then the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom ... were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: But the wise took oil in their vessels , with their lamps ... "and you know the rest (Matthew 25:1-13). This beginning of Matthew 25 more than a 'parable' is a continuation of the 'prophecy' in Matthew 24 as Jesus revealed it what would happen to the church prior to his return, just at the time that his gospel of kingdom would be preached! Notice how it begins: "Then the kingdom of heaven be ..."</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Well, we know that all believers were virgins because they called him 'Lord', they all knew that he would return to find and awaited his coming, they all had a lamp, it all fell asleep waiting, they all heard the announcement and all awoke, all fixed lamps and went out to meet you all, why then do not all get in? What was the determining factor? ...</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">OIL! What determined that some were taken and others left WAS THE OIL. While for some the oil was not important, for others it was a must! And what does the oil: The Holy Spirit: "Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him ... and ... the Spirit of the Lord came upon David" (1 Samuel 16:13), what about the lamps?, The witnesses and their testimony: "You are the light of the world ... Let your light shine before men" (Matthew 5:14-16). What we have then in this prophetic parable of the 10 virgins?: Two different types of believers, a 'dependent Holy Spirit' and others not, the product of what, two different gospels, as Jesus prophesied! Who is going to be taken?, Those that depend on the Holy Spirit to fulfill God's will.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Section 8</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Jesus said, "Learn from me ... for one is your Master" (Matthew 11:29, 23:8). Paul said: "Be imitators of me" (1 Corinthians 11:1). To which of the two you will follow?, Because to meet face to face with the truth about Paul and discover that it was 'an apostle of Jesus Christ' as he claimed to be, and that his gospel was not 'the gospel of Christ' as stated, we are forced to make a decision about who we will follow from now on because you can not follow BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. Who are you going to go then?: What Jesus?, Or to Paul? Today I have found that the solution remains the same as it was 2000 years ago: "When the brothers knew it ... he was sent to Tarsus ... then had the churches rest ... and were built ... and were multiplied by the Holy Spirit" (Acts 9:30-31). We must return to the place from which Paul came to the Holy Spirit to do its work, as it can not freely minister to churches while Paul is tucked in between!, And what is more important, Jesus left the starting the Church in the hands of the Holy Spirit, where you think you expect to find when you return? "The Spirit and the bride say, Come" (Revelation 22:17). Who are you going to go then? Jesus did, or does Paul?</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">For those who love Jesus above all, the decision should not be that hard, but for the rest of it is not so easy, I mean those who are dazzled by the verbiage of the supposed 'great apostle' beliefs have shaped their following fundamental teachings and example, and especially to those who have built great ministries whose core message is to exalt the Gospel of Paul more than Jesus! Them if they will be placed uphill! But the cards are already drawn on the table and Biblical truth is irrefutable: Paul disobeyed the Holy Spirit completely getting out of the will of God, he lied to everyone trying to convince them that it was an 'apostle' and forged an entire the new gospel Jesus preached, stealing sheep to 'good shepherd' and dividing the flock. What will they do then? To go on preaching the gospel of Paul?</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">To help you make the right decision, let me putting on the final nail in the coffin of Paul. He wrote to the Galatians: "Though we, or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached, let him be accursed. As we said before, so now ... again: If anyone preach a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be accursed "(Galatians 1:8-9 KJV 1865). Paul delivered a strong curse on any angel or person who preaches 'another gospel' to yours. Having demonstrated that 'the gospel of the kingdom "that Jesus preached was' different 'to Paul, what would that mean then?: That according to Paul ... JESUS ??IS CURSED!, And therefore also the' angel from heaven 'with' the everlasting gospel '. So there you have the wolf in sheep's clothing! That's the great 'apostle' Paul's that we both spoke! But now we've removed the costume! To whom then will follow?</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">Paul is dead and you can not save. His gospel of anything you serve in that day to demand entrance into the kingdom, as we will be judged by the words of Jesus and not by Paul!: "He who rejects Me, and receiveth not my words, hath one judges him: the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day "(John 12:48). We must urgently become the words of Jesus before it's too late, because he alone can save us, provided they follow him on: "If anyone serves me, follow me, and where I am, there shall also my servant" (John 12:25-26). Who do you love more then? It will be seen by who you choose as your only master! Jesus said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments ... He who loves me will keep my word. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine but the Father who sent me "(John 14:15, 21, 23-24).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">If you are someone who love Jesus more than anything and want to return soon, you know what you can do: Spread the news! Helps the prophecy is fulfilled and today begins to preach the gospel of the kingdom. We have many brothers and sisters even to evangelize, not to mention the rest of the world. Jesus before you opened a huge door that no one can close to divulge this message around the world, and a wonderful, simple reason: "... thou hast a little strength (for now we are few), have kept My word, and have not denied my name "(Revelation 3:10, 8). Save and discloses his word and not deny NAME: JESUS! (As they called angels, and not 'Christ' as he called Paul). Np let your name and remain WORD replaced.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium;">And until he returns, recalls: "He who endures to the end shall be saved." Persevere doing what? What he said just before: "the love of many will grow cold. but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. " If in the midst of evil prevailing in the world, the love of many believers is to be cooled, the promise of salvation must then be directed to those whose love is not cool, right? Therefore, to be saved are those who endure to the end doing what? LOVING! "What is written in the law? ... Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself ... do this and live. " God bless you.</span></p>
