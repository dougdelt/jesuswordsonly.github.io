<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Critic at Early Church History</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I just read [<em>i.e.</em>, <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">on&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">January 6, 2013</span>] a critique of:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">[1] my use of Tertullian in Jesus' Words Only (<a href="/recommendedreading/118-chapter-16-jwo.html">chapter 16</a>);&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">[2] my article <a href="/recommendedreading/74-early-church-views.html">Early Church View of Paul</a>:&nbsp;and </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">[3] my synopsis of <a href="/recommendedreading/56-marcionism.html">Marcionism</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">However, I must point out the Church History 101 critic lobs attacks but never links any of my pages to allow his reader to know what I actually do say.&nbsp; We cannot have a discussion of someone's points by witholding them from one's audience.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, I provide here a link to his critique at <a href="http://www.churchhistory101.com/feedback/tertullian-paul-marcionism.php">http://www.churchhistory101.com/feedback/tertullian-paul-marcionism.php</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">The critic's article is entitled " Why Does Tertullian Call Paul 'The Apostle of the Heretics?"&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Several times the author -- unidentified -- identifies me by name, and says that I am misleading.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I will let the reader decide.</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, san-serif, arial; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1">Tertullian's Main Quote on Questioning</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, san-serif, arial; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1"> Whether Jesus Truly Chose Paul as An </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, san-serif, arial; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1">Apostle</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">First, the unidentified critic admits that my main quote from Tertullian is correct. This is the quote in which Tertullian says: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">[1] he found nothing in the gospels that says Paul is an apostle of Jesus Christ; and [2] Paul's self-serving claim to being Jesus's apostle does not suffice as proof it is so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Thus, as to that passage, the critic admits:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"This is indeed a text from Tertullian's&nbsp;</span><em style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, san-serif, arial; line-height: 16px;">Against Marcion</em><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">."</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">But then he does not deal with what the passage says. He tries to imply Tertullian said Paul was an apostle of Jesus -- which Tertullian never says in <em>Against Marcion. </em>In fact in the passage at issue from Tertullian, Tertullian clearly refutes that Paul is an apostle of Jesus Christ based upon Scripture, and its clear implications:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="color: #494a44; line-height: 21px;" data-mce-mark="1">I desire to hear from Marcion <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the origin of Paul the apostle</span></strong></span></span><span style="font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"></span><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="color: #494a44; line-height: 21px;" data-mce-mark="1">.

Instead, the critic lifts other text which I included, and which I noted does not prove Tertullian says Paul is an apostle of Jesus, and yet the critic distorts it so that when Tertullian says Paul is 'mine' the critic says this supposedly implies Tertullian believes Paul is Jesus' apostle. However, Tertullian never says this, nor does he imply that Paul is Jesus' apostle -- the question at issue. What the critic says in response is instead:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Tertullian throughout Against Marcion shows how Marcion's understanding of Paul does not square with reason, Jesus, or Paul himself. Tertullian's approach is typically "Paul says this," but `you Marcion do not understand.' However, in <strong>a stretch of four chapters beginning at chapter 23 to chapter 27 of Book One, Tertullian does a 180 degree turn</strong>. He discusses doctrines of&nbsp;Marcion which come from Paul but <strong>Tertullian never mentions Paul</strong>. Then <strong>Tertullian crushes each doctrine in turn. The interesting thing is that each of these doctrines were unquestionably Pauline</strong>. However, Tertullian no longer could attack Marcion for taking Paul out of context or misunderstanding him. These topics that Tertullian attacked in chapters 23 through 27 were: salvation by faith alone, eternal security, predestination and total depravity.&nbsp;</span></p>

Instead of quoting Paul or using clearly Pauline verbiage, and then explaining his `true meaning,' <strong>Tertullian simply destroyed the substance behind all of Paul's major doctrines</strong>. Tertullian did so with logic and reason deduced from the nature of God revealed in Scripture. Paulinists today might not accept these deductions because Tertullian does not use our modern `citation' method to refute a point. However, the issue I am raising here is not to ask you to agree with Tertullian. Rather I ask you to acknowledge that the very early church was proving as heresy everything that Paulinists emphasize today as valid.</span></p>

Tertullian challenges whether Paul is one of the 12 apostles. Tertullian is clear that Paul is not; that a self-serving claim by Paul does not prove Paul is a true apostle. Also, Tertullian asks whether it makes any sense that Jesus had to pick another after He ascended into heaven. &nbsp;(See the quote above.) Tertullian says it would reflect some lack of planning by our Lord. Also, in the quote below, Tertullian argues that Paul's behavior in Acts 15 was not one who was an equal apostle, but one who instead sought to have his doctrines confirmed by the 12 -- for Paul to see whether Paul himself went too far. So those critiques of Paul's apostleship are in the quotes on my webpage (see below) which the critic lifted the quote above which appears in chapter sixteen. (On this quote about Acts 15, see heading below Tertullian Does Refute Paul Was An Apostle Equal to yer 12 in Acts 15</span>.<span style="font-size: 14pt;">) And they are based on Tertullian's acceptance of Acts! But the critic has not absorbed the point. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, Tertullian's statement that Peter and James and John "gave right hand of fellowship" to Paul does not imply they regarded him as an apostle of Jesus Christ. <strong>The critic errs by leaping to that conclusion</strong>. Tertullian's other words were too harsh, partly based upon Acts 15, to prove otherwise. And this was key to Tertullian's efforts to disprove Marcionism. For Marcion was claiming that Paul was the only true apostle.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">To prove Tertullian believed Paul was an inspired apostle, the Church History critic also quotes chapter 15 from&nbsp;<strong>a totally different book of Tertullian's</strong> <em>-- On Baptism. </em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1">It is true that&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1"><em>On Baptism</em> speaks about Paul as an apostle which in <em>A</em></span></span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1"><em>gainst Marcion</em>&nbsp;Tertullian clearly refutes being proven or known</span>. Thus, to know if this is relevant to interpret <em>Against Marcion</em>, one must know whether <em>On Baptism </em>came before or&nbsp;after <em>Against Marcion</em>. It turns out the critic improperly put weight on a book written earlier in time by Tertullian. The book&nbsp;<strong><em>On Baptism</em> is placed as Tertullian's third book written, while <em>Against Marcion</em> is Tertullian's 23d or 24th book</strong>. See "Possible Chronology" in "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1">Tertullian</span></a>," Wikipedia. </span></p>

It appears that Chadwick realizes Tertullian's arguments not only skewer heretics but also <strong>simultaneously embarass those who wish to rely upon Paul</strong>. The Early Church Critic apparently is acknowledging this is a legitimate view, commenting on Chadwick to his email correspondent: "<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>just as you have pointed out below -- he [<em>i.e.,</em> Tertullian]<em>&nbsp;</em>seems to be attacking the real apostle Paul</strong></span>.</span>"</span>&nbsp;So it appears the Church History critic realizes scholars like Chadwick believe Tertullian's criticism of extreme Paulinists like Marcion goes as far as to embarass those who wish to rely upon Paul as orthodox.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Before I discuss in depth how Tertullian used Acts 15 to prove Paul was not an apostle on par with the twelve, and thus was simply a messenger (potentially a confusing one) in the loose non-title meaning of "apostlos," let's discuss the main point of the critic's article.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, san-serif, arial; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1">Apostle of the Heretics?</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Next the critic takes on a passage where Tertullian says in Latin that Paul is the "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">apostle of the heretics</span></strong>." In 2010, when I first wrote the online article about this, I pointed out that it is mistranslated in one translation as "the apostle <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>whom the heretics adopt</strong></span>." This critic lifts that quote I provided, then pretends that the lattter is unquestionably correct, and does not say "apostle of the heretics" -- and has the <strong>audacity to imply</strong> (a) I did not mention this alternative translation; (b) imply I am being deceptive; and (c) the <strong>critic omits that I asserted that "whom the heretics adopt" was clearly a translation error</strong>. The critic omits that I quoted the original Latin to prove my point -- which meaning is self-evident. (I received a certificate in school for excellence in translating Latin, so I am certain of the proper translation.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, who is being deceptive? The critic or me? This anonymous critic borrows my quote of a mistranslation which I quoted to be fair, and then without acknowledging it, he uses it to disprove my translation without including my refutation of such a competing translation. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">As I will demonstrate below, any modern reader today no longer has to be <strong>bamboozled </strong>by efforts to mislead on translations. Below I will show that just using google.translate, everyone can see that the original Latin text does not have "the apostle whom the heretics adopt...." It clearly is "apostle of the heretics."</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">So here is the critic's misleading presentation -- taking part of what I acknowledged was in an English translation -- which I disputed as in error, and then the critic uses it to imply I ignored it, but does not tell the reader (again) that in fact I already acknowledged it. Then the critic misleadingly omits that I already refuted that translation. The critic writes:</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">By the way, the critic at Early Church History has since told me that this last sentence does not mean that Tertullian meant "Marcion was apostle of the heretic(s)." This then means the critic is saying Tertullian is "referring to" Paul "as the apostle of the heretic (Marcion)" which would mean the critic at Early Church History is indeed <strong>finally agreeing with me</strong>. So that undercuts the entire thrust of his online article. I am truly stumped!@ &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Because I could not imagine the critic was conceding my point, I initially interpreted the critic as saying that Tertullian was referring to 'apostle of the heretic' as Marcion -- reading the parenthesis to refer to "apostle" and not "heretic." But now with his explanation, I am truly baffled because he intends a reader of his webpage to agree with me that Tertullian was "referring to" Paul as "the apostle of Marcion." While this does not directly call Paul an heretic, I never said it does. Such a reference by the critic thus means that he acknowledges that Tertullian meant Paul is the "messenger" (apostle) of the heretic Marcion,&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1"><em>i.e.</em>, Paul is to blame for Marcion's message because Paul is carrying the same message on many points. So in the end the critic explained the above quote of his words to effectively concede my translation of Tertullian. I am truly stumped how he can level his criticisms when in the end he conceded the point. Mysteries never cease.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Regardless, let me defend expressly whether Tertullian's words were &nbsp;"apostle of the heretics" in Latin.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">We will also see who is misleading whom on the question whether the translation is "apostle of the heretics" (which is clearly negative about Paul) or does it say, as the critic quotes, "the apostle whom the heretics adopt" which is more neutral?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">First, my remarks about "apostle of the heretics" were not in <em>Jesus' Words Only</em> but I found it after 2007.&nbsp; I first put it online in 2010. Here is what I wrote in 2010 in my article - <a href="/recommendedreading/74-early-church-views.html">Early Church Views of Paul</a>:&nbsp;</span></p>

In Latin, he called Paul "<strong>haereticorum</strong>&nbsp;<strong>apostolus</strong>."&nbsp;One commentator says this meant "the&nbsp;<strong>writings of Paul</strong>&nbsp;--- the haereticorum apostolos of Tertullian --- &nbsp;were&nbsp;<strong>regarded suspiciously</strong>&nbsp;at Rome." (Hans Lietzmann,<em>The Lord's Supper</em>&nbsp;(Brill: 1979) at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1bsUAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA282&amp;ots=oCfZPSLxMs&amp;dq=haereticorum%20apostolus&amp;pg=PA282" style="color: #517291; text-decoration: underline;">282</a>.) Tertullian spoke with justification. Among the early gnostic heretics, their writings refer to Paul as "the great (or greatest) apostle" and "Paul who has become like Christ." (A. H. B. Logan, A. J. M. Wedderburn,&nbsp;<em>New Testament and Gnosis</em>&nbsp;(2004) at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=qSdnK6qLhNgC&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;ots=ubigbdORV_&amp;dq=haereticorum%20apostolus&amp;pg=PA13" style="color: #517291; text-decoration: underline;">13</a>.) Tertullian was correct: Paul was the "apostle of the heretics."</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Incidentally, to downplay this "apostle of the heretics" designation, some have suggested Tertullian meant to write "<strong>ethnicorum</strong>&nbsp;apostolus" meaning "apostle of the gentiles." Editors, however, reject this solution as "unnecessary." See&nbsp;<em>Ante-Nicene Library</em>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-iXeFqwwF1UC&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=haereticorum%20apostolus&amp;pg=PA126" style="color: #517291; text-decoration: underline;">126</a>&nbsp;fn 5. But I reject it because the context and views of Tertullian prove Tertullian meant precisely what he said. Paul was the "apostle of the heretics."</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Also to hide "apostle of the heretics" in the Latin original, the English translations mollify the words. In the&nbsp;<em>Ante-Nicene Fathers</em>&nbsp;by Schaff, it offers an English translation which replaces this clear expression with these words instead: "When the&nbsp;<strong>very apostle whom our heretics adopt</strong>&nbsp;. . ." (<em>Id.</em>, at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bu-pvKBmXhAC&amp;lpg=PA324&amp;dq=the%20very%20apostle%20whom%20our%20heretics%20adopt&amp;pg=PA324#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20very%20apostle%20whom%20our%20heretics%20adopt&amp;f=false" style="color: #517291; text-decoration: underline;">324</a>&nbsp;col. 2.)&nbsp;</span></p>

I did mention the <em>Ante-Nicene</em> editors downplayed the true words "apostle of the heretics" by rendering it as "the very apostle whom our heretics adopt." You can see that the critic took that quote, and <strong>misleadingly implied I omitted it. </strong>Then the critic without mentioning that I said it violates the "clear expression" in Latin -- which I quoted in Latin -- the critic simply says that it <strong>proves I am supposedly wrong, misleading and originally suggested I was "lying"</strong> (which he has since removed, for which I thank him). I accept his withdrawal of that charge, but he still has left the 'misleading' remark, which in my mind is entirely unjustified, so I do not yet regard this alteration enough to state the facts. I am proving here, I trust, that in no way am I misleading. In fact I am correct, which rules out any effort to mislead</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Specifically, when I said "apostle of the heretics" was a clear expression, this is because I can read Latin. Just for the record, here again is the original Latin text of the entire sentence, to prove I was correct that Schaff <strong>mistranslated</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>clear</strong><strong> language</strong> -- evidently to soften the negative view it implies about Paul by Tertullian:</span></p>

The ending -<em>orum</em> to the word participle&nbsp;<em>haeretic&nbsp;</em>adds the meaning "of". So in Latin, it says "of the heretics apostle," which in translating Latin to English is reversed to be "apostle of the heretics." There is nothing about "the apostle adopted by the heretics."

(The scholar was loosely paraphrasing Schaff who rendered haereticorum apostolus more negatively than as paraphrased -- that "haereticorum apostolus" should read "the apostle whom the heretics adopt.") The scholar defends this even softer rendering he proposes, however, as the intended meaning by means of looking backward at the "whole flow of the 5 books" of Tertullian's <em>Against Marcion</em>.&nbsp;Thus, the modification made by the translator Schaff comes close to the &nbsp;interpretation which the scholar believes is legitimate rather than was an illegitimate effort to downplay Tertullian having a critical view of Paul.&nbsp;</span></p>

Schaff took too much license -- unjustified license -- to mollify the words which <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a translator is not permitted to do</strong></span>. The critic friend of Early Church History took it one step further. He said we should interpret it as "the apostle whom the heretics <strong><span style="line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1">try</span> </strong>to use." Clearly, the strain of the literal words are being resisted.</span></span></p>

Tertullian refutes all the core doctrines of Paul -- faith alone, eternal security and predestination. He does so claiming that these are doctrines of Marcion. But the elephant in the room is Paul - obviously. That alone answers that adding into a translation -- whether "the apostle whom the heretics try to use" (a further mollification by the scholar friend of the critic) or what Schaff said -- "the apostle whom the heretics adopt" -- are unjustified even if translators were permitted to add interpretations into the text. But of course, translators are not permitted to add interpretations into the text.</span></span></p>

Please remember that the Early Church History critic previously posted an entire webpage saying I was wrong about both; said I was potentially misleading people and he even initially accused me of this "lying thing." (To his credit, he withdrew that.) But his<strong> own scholar friend admitted the essential two facts which refute the critic's two key points about "haeriticorum apostolus."</strong> While his scholar friend did justify a loose interpretation in light of all five books of <em>Against Marcion</em>, his scholar friend's interpretation offered to help the critic is refuted by other scholars, and by the clear proofs presented here and in JWO.</span></span></p>

But the scholar from Austrialia errs. T</span>he points I quote above, the points I raised in JWO ch. 16, and now the points coming next below all prove that Tertullian is indeed <strong>directly negative about Paul's authority and about the sense one can refer to Paul as an apostle</strong> - whether on par with the 12 or just a 'messenger' - the literal meaning of the word 'apostle.' &nbsp;Indeed, it is the entire context of&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1"><em>Against Marcion</em> that makes it clear "apostle of the heretics" was a deliberate and highly negative reference to Paul by Tertullian.</span></span></span></p>

The scholar says "apostle" is a very "loose term." (See entire excerpt of the scholar's email below.) Indeed, "apostle" has an ordinary meaning of simply <em>messenger</em><em>. </em>Only rarely in scripture is it intended to refer to the <em>office</em> of one appointed directly by Jesus, and enjoying the status of 12 judges over the 12 tribes, as Jesus appointed the 12.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1">In response, I would only say that Tertullian used the term "apostle" loosely sometimes about Paul, but when it came down to whether Paul was an apostle with authority direct from Jesus (tested against what Acts depicts) or only directly from the true apostles, it is very clear in the next quote that Paul is no more an apostle than you or me. Tertullian therefore used the term 'apostle' loosely about Paul in the quote below and the other references cited in the scholar's email. (See below.) In the next quote below, Tertullian clearly negated Paul was an apostle on par with the 12. It is a near universal misimpression today that extending the "right hand of fellowship" to Paul means the 12 regarded Paul as an apostle and one equal to themselves. But while Tertullian quotes that "right hand" passage, Tertullian uses the fact Paul came to Jerusalem in Acts 15 to gain approval of his views on circumcision as <strong><em>proof Paul did not regard himself an equal apostle to the 12</em></strong>, and thus we cannot help but note the true 12 never call Paul an apostle at all.</span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">As I find so often true of Paulinists who criticize my work, they cannot fairly address my points. They have to distort what I am saying, and then attack that. (I use quotes from what another says so I am not guilty of distorting what they say.) Certainly,Tertullian does refute that Paul is an apostle of Jesus Christ. But as I pointed out, Tertullian said Paul is "mine" and refers to Paul as an inferior "later apostle" -- which in Latin and Greek only means "messenger." Only 12 enjoyed the title of "Apostles of Jesus Christ," as Tertullian previously in the same context had proven. Thus, Tertullian only meant Paul had edifying messages. In the same context, Tertullian insists Paul did not have an authority equal to the 12 apostles, and if Paul wrote a gospel, it would have no validity unless the 12 approved it and it matched their gospels. Tertullian cites Acts 15 as proof. To remind the Church History critic, what Tertullian said about Paul plainly and simply, and which I said in <a href="/recommendedreading/118-chapter-16-jwo.html">chapter sixteen of JWO</a> since 2007, is the following:</span></p>

Paul's authority was not recognized as direct from Jesus or by revelation. It only derived from Paul's recognition by the twelve apostles. He was their disciple, and they were Paul's masters.

Thus, scurrilous dust is thrown up, but how it is supposed to prove I am supposedly "lying" and "misleading" anyone is beyond me.</span></p>

That I am supposedly misleading by saying someone believes in faith alone without mentioning someone also exhorts followers to avoid marriage? Or does my mention that Marcion believed in faith alone allegedly automatically suggest both Paul and Marcion are sloths? I never said nor implied such a thing</span>. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">This critic's claim is utter nonsense. But this should help people on the fence see how <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">bottom-of-the-barrel the arguments to defend Paul become</span></strong>. Their need to use low-blows suggests to me that the author knows he has nothing he can say -- so he just tries to throw dirt, even if there is nothing express he or she can find wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Th</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 24px;">en the critic moves on to Bercot, but I soon come back into view. He claims that the Marcionites believed that it was better not to marry proved they had some sense of works being important, and hence they were not licentious. (I never said or implied they were licentious.) Here is what the cri</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; background-color: transparent;">tic says:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="color: #000000; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1">[<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The author of JWO] and Bercot present Gnostics as those who believed their salvation was completely devoid of works. While there were groups like this (ie., the Carpocratians, see Ireneaus,&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, san-serif, arial; line-height: 16px;">A.H.</em><span style="color: #000000; line-height: 16px;" data-mce-mark="1">&nbsp;I.25.4) Marcion's sect was completely different<strong> as I have already explained above.</strong> But [the author of JWO] and Bercot <strong>fail to explain this.</strong> It is easier to make the Gnostics out to be "salvation by grace alone" liberals and to then link this with the apostle Paul.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">What the critic explained earlier, to which he refers, is that Marcionites taught Paul's doctrine that abstention from marriage was the rule of life to follow. As Paul never suggested abstention was necessary to be justified for salvation, neither did Marcion. For Marcion's rule was 100% clear that any disobedience of God / sin never jeapardized one's salvation as long as one had faith (see <a href="/recommendedreading/56-marcionism.html">link</a>), just as Paul appears in many places to teach eternal security (while in many places Paul appears to teach the opposite).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">So Marcion's sect was not completely devoid of ethics -- and I never implied they were. I said they were Paulinists - extremely so - and every word of Paul was hung onto. He was their only apostle. They expressly rejected the 12. Thus, if Paul said it is better not to marry, the Marcionites followed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, I did not omit anything material about Marcion that needed mentioning. What the critic brings up simply proves more proximity between Paul and Marcion than we mentioned in our articles -- Paul and Marcion shared the exhortation to abstention. Thus, when the critic tries to imply I or Bercot have left out something, it is not true. However, &nbsp;even if we did, had we included it, the facts about abstention STRENGTHENS our point, not weakens it. The critic has misanalyzed the marriage practices of Marcion as somehow non-Pauline when they are 100% Pauline.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Re: His claim that Tertullian said Paul was an apostle of Jesus Christ.</strong>&nbsp;The critic erroneously cites as proof for this erroneous view that Tertullian cites Acts 15 in which Paul was extended the right hand of fellowship by the 12. But that quote does not say Paul was accepted as an apostle of Jesus Christ by the 12. Paul was accepted as a witness to events with Gentiles - nothing more. Tertullian makes this clear even while Tertullian quotes that passage. Tertullian relying upon Acts 15 says Paul was anxious to submit to the 12, and needed to be sure his doctrine matched the 12. Based on Acts 15, Tertullian concludes<em><strong> even a gospel written by Paul would, by itself, have no authority</strong></em>. This tells you indirectly that Tertullian does not regard the Damascus-road appearance accounts in Acts as appointing Paul an apostle -- and indeed, in each of the 3 passages (found in Acts 9, 22, and 26), the "Jesus" whom Paul meets never calls Paul an Apostle. That "Jesus" says Paul will be a "witness" - "martus" in Greek. The fact Paul was treated as a legitimate witness of the Gentile ministry by the apostles, and was given the "right hand" of fellowship by the true 12, which Tertullian mentions, does not prove to Tertullian that they accepted Paul as an apostle with equal authority from Jesus. Any reference to Paul as an apostle in&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><em>Against Marcion</em> was, in the final analysis, proven to be a loose use of the term, and hence no proof that contradicts Tertullian's final conclusion that Paul had no authority direct from Jesus, but only to whatever extent that the 12 gave Paul any authority. Clearly, in full context, Tertullian said Paul was not an apostle appointed by Jesus, and we need not give Paul any independent authority.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Re: His claim Tertullian supposedly did not say Paul was the apostle of the heretics.</strong>&nbsp;The correct translation of the Latin at issue is that Paul is the "apostle of the heretics" -- a very fitting title. Even the scholar friend of the critic concurs I was correct on the actual Latin in the text.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Re: His claim I supposedly imply the Marcionites were licentious because I mention they believed in salvation by faith alone. </strong>This is illogical, and I never implied the Marcionites were licentious. The critic then disproves the Marcionites were licentious by proving they practiced abstention from marriage. Kudos to him for his Straw Man argument. But his argument backfired because it only strengthens my point that Marcionites were extreme Paulinists. &nbsp;Paul exhorted such abstention. &nbsp;The Marcionites took Paul as 100% the gospel to obey. But the rest of the church did not adhere to Paul's doctrines including on abstention from marriage as the better path, proving my point that Paul was little regarded back then.</span></li>

Marc. 5.1.2 [CCL 1.664]), whom&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;is quite happy to call an apostle in this section, so the seeming criticism of Paul (that he if Jesus wanted him as an apostle he would have called him as one while he was alive, and anyone can call themself an apostle without necessarily being one - Adu. Marc. 5.1.3 [CCL 1.664]) will be revealed to be a dummy pass (I think that is Australian - sleight of hand). When&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;says here that Paul is not listed as an apostle that is not his final position on the matter, by the end of this chapter&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;is defending Paul's apostolic credentials.

Marc. 5.1.8 [CCL 1.665]), and that&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;respects Paul's writings while Marcion mutilates them (and interprets them to suit himself (Adu. Marc. 5.1.9 [CCL 1.665]). In this section&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;uses the word apostolus 6 times and they all undoubtedly refer to Paul.&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;is not interested to prove Paul's apostleship, that is done so by the creator in Gen. 49:27. Of course, a good oponent could charge that&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;was doing the same thing as Marcion is misinterpreting Paul, but he anticipates that argument in all his writings by trying to demonstrate how his interpretation agrees with the regula fidei.&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;does not score own goals (at least not in his own mind), he is rescuing Paul by showing that Marcion's interpretations are illegal. Of course, as many scholars have grappled with,&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>'s problem is how to preserve the newness of the NT while defending the value of the OT and how to undermine the Jews without throwing out the OT.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></span></p>

Marc. 1.23-27, it must be pointed out that it is a standard practice of<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;(which comes from his rhetorical training), that he attacks on opponent on several fronts to make his argument look stronger. Often&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;will produce arguments from Scripture and arguments from reason and arguments from practice, the cumulation of which suggest that the opponent has no way out. This is what we find in these chapters.&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;turns to reason, and that is why he does not refer to Paul. The main focus here is on philosophical qualities of a divine being - justice, goodness, etc. I really do not see that&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;is engaged in any significant way in questions like justification by faith or predestination in these chapters, but maybe I have missed something.

Marc. 3.5, let me say again or in different words, the term is typical of the way&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;uses language - it is a brief and shorthand way of saying something that one can truly only interpret and translate by reading the wider context. It is clear here that the wider context of the whole flow of the 5 books Adu. Marc. means that what one has to understand is that the term means - the apostle whom the heretics try to use. It is true the Latin does not say that, but it is impossible to translate&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;literally most of the time as his sentences simply are too dense to make sense of without grasping his sense. It is not a question of downplaying what the words say but of trying to get behind them.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></span></p>

This is true in some respects (as the influence of Montanism grew for example, and with regard to questions like repentance and remarriage), but it is not true here. It is simply WRONG. A better way of interpreting&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;is to take into account the different objectives he has in different works - a different audience means that&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;tries to achieve different things. It is entirely legitimate to refer to De bapt. to get a sense of how&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>, away from the polemic with Marcion, understands Paul's apostleship. The other assumption here is that in Adu. Marc.&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;was<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></span></p>

More significantly, what is the point of all of this? Whether or not Paul was an apostle is of very little importance. This is a loose term, and nothing much can depend upon whether or not one was or was not an apostle. The point seems to be that Paul contradicts Jesus and that if we get rid of Paul then we have a pure Jesus and that is all we need. One finds this argument in a particular style of Christianity, one that I certainly do not adhere to, but it is not something that I would care to take the time now to deal with, since that could be an endless and fruitless task. One either has an ecclesial sense of authority of Scripture or one has a more personal sense. All I would point out is that we have no access to the words of Jesus except as they are mediated through the human authors who, despite divine inspiration, nonetheless contributed their human foibles to their writings. Orthodox Christians of the earliest generations did accept the writings of Paul as a true and legitimate expression of the gospel.&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;is to be counted among them. Issues about any Montanism are completely irrelevant since, let me stress,&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian&nbsp;</span>never left the church and never was condemned by the church.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></span></p>

Marc. clear - no where does&nbsp;<span class="il" style="background-color: #ffffcc;">Tertullian</span>&nbsp;actually deny that Paul was an apostle.
