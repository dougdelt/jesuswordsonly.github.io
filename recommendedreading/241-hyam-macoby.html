<h1>Hyam Maccoby</h1>
<h1><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">Overview</span></strong></span></h1>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">Hyam Maccoby wrote a groundbreaking work entitled&nbsp;<em>The Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity</em> (San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1986).</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">A Talmudic scholar, Hyam Maccoby, does not believe in Paul's conversion, and in his work <em>The Mythmaker</em> he attempts to expose Paul as a self-deluded fraud (I believe Paul instead was a victim) and a "police officer" for the Sadducee High Priest.</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Maccoby claims Paul subverted the beliefs of the Jerusalem Church, Jesus' earliest followers. In <em>The Mythmaker</em>, Hyam Maccoby theorizes that Paul was raised among&nbsp;mystery religions which featured dying and resurrected saviors, then later converted to Judaism, hoping to become a Pharisee. He went to Jerusalem with this goal, but was unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">Needing work, Paul became a police officer under the authority of the Sadducee High Priest, and was assigned to persecute dissidents against Rome. This caused internal conflict. While traveling to&nbsp;Damascus on a clandestine mission to arrest Nazarenes, Maccoby says Paul's &nbsp;psychological crisis peaked. Maccoby claims Paul's revelation was thus actually a resolution of his divided self. He fused the mystery religions, &nbsp;Judaism and the Jerusalem Church into an entirely new belief and centered it on the figure of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">The rest of Paul's life was spent codifying the new faith. However, the Jerusalem Church members were devout Jews and did not hold with his beliefs. To strengthen his stand, Maccoby says Paul invented his own account of&nbsp;events of his life and claimed an early dispute and later agreement with the Jerusalem Church. </span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">To the latter point, I concur; Paul implausibly claims in Galatians that the Jerusalem Church ceded him the sole right to evangelize Gentiles which contravenes Acts 11 and 15 where Peter is given a vision from God telling him to evangelize Gentiles. And in Acts 15, Peter recounts he, Peter, is the Apostle to the Gentiles by appointment of the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Hyam Maccoby explains the fiction that was created later that Peter and Paul were in doctrinal agreement on Paul's anti-Law (Torah) views:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">“As we have seen, the purposes of the book of Acts is to minimize the conflict between Paul and the leaders of the Jerusalem Church, James and Peter. Peter and Paul, in later Christian tradition, became twin saints, brothers in faith, and the idea that <em><strong>they were historically bitter opponents standing for irreconcilable religious standpoints would have been repudiated with horror</strong></em>. The work of the author of Acts was well done; he rescued Christianity [N:SAULIANITY] from the imputation of being the individual creation of Paul, and instead gave it a respectable pedigree, as a doctrine with the authority of the so-called Jerusalem Church, conceived as continuous in spirit with the Pauline Gentile Church of Rome.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">"Yet, for all his efforts, the truth of the matter is not hard to recover, if we examine the New Testament evidence with an eye to tell-tale inconsistencies and confusions, rather than with the determination to gloss over and harmonize all difficulties in the interests of an orthodox interpretation.” (<em>The Mythmake</em>r, <em>supra</em>, at&nbsp;139.)</span></p>
<h1><strong><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #0000ff; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">My Analysis</span></strong></h1>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Maccoby frequently engages in speculation. However, because he is Jewish, he is willing to call out Paul for apostasy from the law, and unscrupulous behavior. The examples are self evident in the Book of Acts, but our Christian commentators will not make mention of these obvious points. Thus, while many inferences of Maccoby are plausible, they are nevertheless insubstantial speculation. No doubt they are interesting. They could be true. But we just don't know. On the other hand, Maccoby's freedom to make observations about Paul's character are refreshing and informative for true followers of Christ. We do not realize how years of conditioning through sermons have influenced us to not identify character flaws or immoral behavior in Paul.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Error of Rejecting Atonement Figure As A Pagan Idea</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">One error that Maccoby suffers from actually impacts his otherwise astute observances. Maccoby believes that a suffering Messiah who dies to atone for our sins is unique to Paul. He claims it is adopted from paganism. Thus, &nbsp;Maccoby says whenever the Gospels mention the atoning sacrifice of Christ, this is supposedly a unique Pauline doctrine written into the Gospels. As a result, Maccoby contends that all four Gospels are Pauline. (Maccoby,&nbsp;<em>The Mythmaker</em>, at 4.)</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">Maccoby mixes in with this indeed some Christology by Paul that is false, and unbiblical -- that Jesus was a "divine" person who came from heaven to die for sins rather than a descendent of David by the flesh who does so. (I expose this error in Paul's Flawed Christology). But one cannot throw out the baby with the bathwater. Maccoby depicts Paul as going beyond Judais:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">On the face of it, Paul's doctrine of Jesus is a daring departure from Judaism. Paul was advocating doctrine that seemed to have far more in common with pagan myths that with Judaism: that Jesus was a divine-human person who had descended to Earth from the heavens and <strong><em>experienced death for the express purpose of saving mankind</em></strong>. (Maccoby,&nbsp;<span id="_mce_caret" data-mce-bogus="1"><em>The Mythmaker</em><span id="_mce_caret" data-mce-bogus="true">,&nbsp;<span id="_mce_caret" data-mce-bogus="1">at 12.)</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1"> But the bolded portion was Biblical. The notion of a divine person coming from heaven was built on mistranslations in the Septuagint, which lined up with Hellenistic pagan culture and no doubt found a home among some Jews. But the atonement principle by a Messiah-type figure was properly Jewish as it most clearly exists in Isaiah 53.</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">for Judaism already had the concept, very clearly outlined in Isaiah chapter 53, about an atoning sacrifice of a human figure in the future. While parts of this passage were deliberately mistranslated by the Masoretes in the 9th Century AD, the Dead Ses Scrolls allow us to affirmatively prove the deception. </span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">This passage indeed is about an atoning figure who after death sees the light (of life) again. </span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence it is scurrilous to call teachings of the Bible pagan. However, many Jewish educators seek to do so to try to distance Judaism further from Christianity than is appropriate or necessary. While Judaism is completely justified in rejecting Pauline Christianity because it defines itself as an anti-Torah version of a Jewish sect, but for Jewish leaders to claim that it is a pagan notion that there will be an atoning figure in the future, even though clearly depicted in Isaiah 53, is unjustified and somewhat blasphemous.</span></p>

<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">I will highlight below various topics where Maccoby makes sober commentary about Paul that is valid for Christians to consider.</span></p>
<h1><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Paul Admits to Unscrupulous Hiding of His Views</span></strong></span></h1>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">Maccoby on page 156-57 highlights facts that support that in Acts 21 verse 27 that the" Jews from Asia" was a reference to Christian Jews. In the course of trying to prove that point, which is indeed likely true, Maccoby mentions points that I would cite as proof why Luke himself is unaware of Paul's anti-Torah position. Maccoby does not see that point from what he is saying, but it equally follows. I suspect Maccoby believes that Luke also is anti-nomian (anti-Torah) because Maccoby assumes Luke and all the gospels are "Pauline." But this is unjustified in light of the fact that Luke's gospel has Jesus endorse the continuity of the law itself. See Luke chapter 16.</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">In any event, here is the very informative opinion of Maccoby:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">who were the Jews from Asia? Why were they so violently opposed to Paul? If what Paul himself says about his preaching Jews on his missionary journeys is correct,<em><strong> they had no reason to believe him to be an apostate from Judaism,</strong></em> for Paul's method when approaching Jews is described by him as:"To Jews I became like a Jew, to win Jews; as they are subject to the law of Moses, I put myself under that law to win them, although I am not myself subject to it." (One Corinthians 9:20-22). <em><strong>It was only to his Gentile converts that Paul revealed that he regarded the Torah as obsolete</strong></em>; and he may have revealed this also to Jewish converts to Christianity, when he considered that their progress in understanding had reached such a level that they would be receptive to anti-Torah teaching. The news of his abandonment of the Torah was thus confined to the Jesus movement itself, where it caused such anxiety that Jewish Christian emissaries have been sent out combat his teaching, and Paul himself had been summoned twice to Jerusalem to answer charges before the supreme Tribunal of the Nazarenes. (Maccoby,&nbsp;<em>The Mythmaker</em> (1986) at 156-57.)</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, Maccoby recognizes that Paul selectively reveal his anti-Torah doctrine. But it is not necessarily the case that Paul revealed to Luke, a Gentile convert, that this was the case. For clearly Luke in his Gospel portrays Jesus as Lord here and in the law would never be taken away for the duration of generations of humans on earth. See Luke chapter 16. So had Maccoby taken that fact into account, he realized that it would be more correct to say Paul would not reveal himself to anyone, even a Gentile convert, who felt strongly that the Torah continued in the New Testament.</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">Maccoby then correctly observes the implication of what epistles of Paul then represent. They clearly were intended for audience were already known to be receptive to the doctrines they taught. Maccoby on page 157 continues:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul's main interest, in any case, was not in converting Jews, but in converting Gentiles, in accordance with his self-description as the' apostle to the Gentiles." It is in his Epistles to is Gentile converts, which have been preserved in the New Testament, that he pours out his <em><strong>real thoughts and expresses his view that salvation does not come from observance of the Torah</strong></em>. These thoughts became known to the Jewish adherence Jesus in the natural course of events, but the Jews as a whole would have <em><strong>no means of learning about them.</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>(Maccoby, <em>The Mythmaker</em> (1986) at 157.)</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">This is very astute reasoning which we can apply to address the question of why Luke includes many embarrassing statements by Paul in the Book of Acts which prove embarrassing only in the light of Paul's Epistles. I have done so elsewhere in the article on Luke's Gospel is a non-Pauline Gospel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">Maccoby Summarizes Ebionites Correctly</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">This portion is essentially correct. &nbsp;I would add that "Ebionite" was the name by which Christians originally went while simultaneously being known as the Nazarenes. It was not a sect distinct from the original. Here is what Maccoby says at page 17:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">A source of information about Paul that has never been taken seriously enough is a group called the Ebionites. Their writings were suppressed by the Church, but some of their views and traditions were preserved in the writings of their opponents, particularly in the huge treatise on Heresies by Epiphanius. From this it appears that the Ebionites had a very different account to give of Paul's background and early life from that found in the New Testament and fostered by Paul himself. The Ebionites testified that Paul had no pharisaic background or training them; he was the son of Gentiles, converted to Judaism, in Tarsus, came to Jerusalem when an adult, and attached himself to the High Priest as a henchman. Disappointed in his hopes of advancement, he broke with the High Priest and sought fame by founding a new religion. ****</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">The <em><strong>Ebionites were stigmatized by the Church as heretics</strong></em> who fail to understand that Jesus was a divine person and asserted instead that he was a human being who came to inaugurate a new earthly age, as prophesied by the Jewish prophets of the Bible. Moreover, <em><strong>the Ebionites refused to accept the Church doctrine, derived from Paul, the Jesus abolished or abrogated the Torah, the Jewish law</strong></em>. Instead the Ebionites observed the Jewish law and regard themselves as Jews. The Ebionites were not heretics, as the Church asserted, nor re--Judaizers, as modern scholars call them, but the authentic successors of the immediate disciples and followers of Jesus, whose views and actions they faithfully transmitted, believing correctly that they were derived from Jesus itself. They were the same group that had earlier been called the Nazarenes, were led by James and Peter, who is known Jesus during his lifetime, and worn a far better position to know his aims to Paul, who met Jesus only in dreams and visions. Thus the opinion held by the Ebionites Nepal is of extraordinary interest deserves respectful consideration, instead of dismissal as scurrilous propaganda, the reaction of Christian scholars from ancient to modern times.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">To Paul, it did not matter whether person was physically enslaved, since this did not affect his spiritual salvation. Thus he urged his disciples to obey Rome, &nbsp;whose power was "ordained of God," and he also urged slaves to be contented with their lot and not to strive for freedom. [1 Cor. 7:22.] This contempt for politics was in fact a political attitude - and acquiescence in the political <em>status quo</em>. Consequently, the <em><strong>Pauline Christian doctrine was fitted from the start to become the official religion of the Roman Empire</strong></em>. Nothing is more welcome to a military empire than a religious doctrine that counsels obedience and acquiescence.

In my earlier book on Jesus,&nbsp;<i><a href="http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/maccoby.htm">Revolution in Judaea</a></i>, I showed how, in the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus speaks and acts as a Pharisee, though the Gospel editors have attempted to conceal this by representing him as opposing Pharisaism even when his sayings were most in accordance with Pharisee teaching. In the present book, I have used the rabbinical evidence to establish an opposite contention: that Paul, whom the New Testament wishes to portray as having been a trained Pharisee, never was one. The consequences of this for the understanding of early Christianity are immense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">In addition to the rabbinical writings, I have made great use of the ancient historians, especially Josephus, Epiphanius and Eusebius. Their statements must be weighed in relation to their particular interests and bias; but when such bias has been identified and discounted, there remains a residue of valuable information. Exactly the same applies to the New Testament itself. Its information is often distorted by the bias of the author or editor, but a knowledge of the nature of this bias makes possible the emergence of the true shape of events.</span></p>

Disputed Epistles, such as Colossians, however pertinent to my argument, have been ignored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">When quoting from the New Testament, I have usually used the New English Bible version, but, from time to time, I have used the Authorized Version or the Revised Version, when I thought them preferable in faithfulness to the original. While the New English Bible is in general more intelligible to modern readers than the older versions, its concern for modern English idiom sometimes obscures important features of the original Greek; and its readiness to paraphrase sometimes allows the translator's presuppositions to colour his translation. I have pointed out several examples of this in the text.</span></p>

<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">In considering the background of Paul, I have returned to one of the earliest accounts of Paul in existence, that given by the Ebionites, as reported by Epiphanius. This account has been neglected by scholars for quite inadequate and tendentious reasons. Robert Graves and Joshua Podro in&nbsp;<i>The Nazarene Gospel Restored</i>&nbsp;did take the Ebionite account seriously; but, though they made some cogent remarks about it, their treatment of the matter was brief. I hope that the present book will do more to alter the prevailing dismissive attitude towards the evidence of this fascinating and important ancient community.</span></p>

<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">At the beginning of Christianity stand two figures: Jesus and Paul. Jesus is regarded by Christians as the founder of their religion, in that the events of his life comprise the foundation story of Christianity; but Paul is regarded as the great interpreter of Jesus' mission, who explained, in a way that Jesus himself never did, how Jesus' life and death fitted into a cosmic scheme of salvation, stretching from the creation of Adam to the end of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">How should we understand the relationship between Jesus and Paul? We shall be approaching this question not from the standpoint of faith, but from that of historians, who regard the Gospels and the rest of the New Testament as an important source of evidence requiring careful sifting and criticism, since their authors were propagating religious beliefs rather than conveying dispassionate historical information. We shall also be taking into account all relevant evidence from other sources, such as Josephus, the Talmud, the Church historians and the Gnostic writings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">What would Jesus himself have thought of Paul? We must remember that Jesus never knew Paul; the two men never once met. The disciples who knew Jesus best, such as Peter, James and John, have left no writings behind them explaining how Jesus seemed to them or what they considered his mission to have been. Did they agree with the interpretations disseminated by Paul in his fluent, articulate writings? Or did they perhaps think that this newcomer to the scene, spinning complicated theories about the place of Jesus in the scheme of things, was getting everything wrong? Paul claimed that his interpretations were not just his own invention, but had come to him by personal inspiration; he claimed that he had personal acquaintance with the resurrected Jesus, even though he had never met him during his lifetime. Such acquaintance, he claimed, gained through visions and transports, was actually superior to acquaintance with Jesus during his lifetime, when Jesus was much more reticent about his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">We know about Paul not only from his own letters but also from the book of Acts, which gives a full account of his life. Paul, in fact, is the hero of Acts, which was written by an admirer and follower of his, namely, Luke, who was also the author of the Gospel of that name. From Acts, it would appear that there was some friction between Paul and the leaders of the 'Jerusalem Church', the surviving companions of Jesus; but this friction was resolved, and they all became the best of friends, with common aims and purposes. From certain of Paul's letters, particularly Galatians, it seems that the friction was more serious than in the picture given in Acts, which thus appears to be partly a propaganda exercise, intended to portray unity in the early Church. The question recurs: what would Jesus have thought of Paul, and what did the Apostles think of him?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">We should remember that the New Testament, as we have it, is much more dominated by Paul than appears at first sight. As we read it, we come across the Four Gospels, of which Jesus is the hero, and do not encounter Paul as a character until we embark on the post-Jesus narrative of Acts. Then we finally come into contact with Paul himself, in his letters. But this impression is misleading, for the earliest writings in the New Testament are actually Paul's letters, which were written about AD 50-60, while the Gospels were not written until the period AD 70-110. This means that the theories of Paul were already before the writers of the Gospels and coloured their interpretations of Jesus' activities. Paul is, in a sense, present from the very first word of the New Testament. This is, of course, not the whole story, for the Gospels are based on traditions and even written sources which go back to a time before the impact of Paul, and these early traditions and sources are not entirely obliterated in the final version and give valuable indications of what the story was like before Paulinist editors pulled it into final shape. However, the dominant outlook and shaping perspective of the Gospels is that of Paul, for the simple reason that it was the Paulinist view of what Jesus' sojourn on Earth had been about that was triumphant in the Church as it developed in history. Rival interpretations, which at one time had been orthodox, opposed to Paul's very individual views, now became heretical and were crowded out of the final version of the writings adopted by the Pauline Church as the inspired canon of the New Testament.</span></p>

<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">This explains the puzzling and ambiguous role given in the Gospels to the companions of Jesus, the twelve disciples. They are shadowy figures, who are allowed little personality, except of a schematic kind. They are also portrayed as stupid; they never quite understand what Jesus is up to. Their importance in the origins of Christianity is played down in a remarkable way. For example, we find immediately after Jesus' death that the leader of the Jerusalem Church is Jesus' brother James. Yet in the Gospels, this James does not appear at all as having anything to do with Jesus' mission and story. Instead, he is given a brief mention as one of the brothers of Jesus who allegedly&nbsp;<i>opposed</i>&nbsp;Jesus during his lifetime and regarded him as mad. How it came about that a brother who had been hostile to Jesus in his lifetime suddenly became the revered leader of the Church immediately after Jesus' death is not explained, though one would have thought that some explanation was called for. Later Church legends, of course, filled the gap with stories of the miraculous conversion of James after the death of Jesus and his development into a saint. But the most likely explanation is, as will be argued later, that the erasure of Jesus' brother dames (and his other brothers) from any significant role in the Gospel story is part of the denigration of the early leaders who had been in close contact with Jesus and regarded with great suspicion and dismay the Christological theories of the upstart Paul, flaunting his brand new visions in interpretation of the Jesus whom he had never met in the flesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Who, then, was Paul? Here we would seem to have a good deal of information; but on closer examination, it will turn out to be full of problems. We have the information given by Paul about himself in his letters, which are far from impersonal and often take an autobiographical turn. Also we have the information given in Acts, in which Paul plays the chief role. But the information given by any person about himself always has to be treated with a certain reserve, since everyone has strong motives for putting himself in the best possible light. And the information given about Paul in Acts also requires close scrutiny, since this work was written by someone committed to the Pauline cause. Have we any other sources for Paul's biography? As a matter of fact, we have, though they are scattered in various unexpected places, which it will be our task to explore: in a fortuitously preserved extract from the otherwise lost writings of the Ebionites, a sect of great importance for our quest; in a disguised attack on Paul included in a text of orthodox Christian authority; and in an Arabic manuscript, in which a text of the early Jewish Christians, the opponents of Paul, has been preserved by an unlikely chain of circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Let us first survey the evidence found in the more obvious and well-known sources. It appears from Acts that Paul was at first called 'Saul', and that his birthplace was Tarsus, a city in Asia Minor (Acts 9:11, and 21:39, and 22:3). Strangely enough, however, Paul himself, in his letters, never mentions that he came from Tarsus, even when he is at his most autobiographical. Instead, he gives the following information about his origins: 'I am an Israelite myself, of the stock of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin' (Romans 11:2); and '... circumcised on my eighth day, Israelite by race, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born and bred; in my attitude to the law, a Pharisee....' (Philippians 3:5). It seems that Paul was not anxious to impart to the recipients of his letters that he came from somewhere so remote as Tarsus from Jerusalem, the powerhouse of Pharisaism. The impression he wished to give, of coming from an unimpeachable Pharisaic background, would have been much impaired by the admission that he in fact came from Tarsus, where there were few, if any, Pharisee teachers and a Pharisee training would have been hard to come by.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">We encounter, then, right at the start of our enquiry into Paul's background, the question: was Paul really from a genuine Pharisaic family, as he says to his correspondents, or was this just something that he said to increase his status in their eyes? The fact that this question is hardly ever asked shows how strong the influence of traditional religious attitudes still is in Pauline studies. Scholars feel that, however objective their enquiry is supposed to be, they must always preserve an attitude of deep reverence towards Paul, and never say anything to suggest that he may have bent the truth at times, though the evidence is strong enough in various parts of his life-story that he was not above deception when he felt it warranted by circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">It should be noted (in advance of a full discussion of the subject) that modern scholarship has shown that, at this time, the Pharisees were held in high repute throughout the Roman and Parthian empires as a dedicated group who upheld religious ideals in the face of tyranny, supported leniency and mercy in the application of laws, and championed the rights of the poor against the oppression of the rich. The undeserved reputation for hypocrisy which is attached to the name 'Pharisee' in medieval and modern times is due to the campaign against the Pharisees in the Gospels -- a campaign dictated by politico-religious considerations at the time when the Gospels were given their final editing, about forty to eighty years after the death of Jesus. Paul's desire to be thought of as a person of Pharisee upbringing should thus be understood in the light of the actual reputation of the Pharisees in Paul's lifetime; Paul was claiming a high honour, which would much enhance his status in the eyes of his correspondents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Before looking further into Paul's claim to have come from a Pharisee background, let us continue our survey of what we are told about Paul's career in the more accessible sources. The young Saul, we are told, left Tarsus and came to the Land of Israel, where he studied in the Pharisee academy of Gamaliel (Acts 22:3). We know from other sources about Gamaliel, who is a highly respected figure in the rabbinical writings such as the Mishnah, and was given the title 'Rabban', as the leading sage of his day. That he was the leader of the whole Pharisee party is attested also by the New Testament itself, for he plays a prominent role in one scene in the book of Acts (chapter 5) -- a role that, as we shall see later, is hard to reconcile with the general picture of the Pharisees given in the Gospels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Yet Paul himself, in his letters, never mentions that he was a pupil of Gamaliel, even when he is most concerned to stress his qualifications as a Pharisee. Here again, then, the question has to be put: was Paul ever really a pupil of Gamaliel or was this claim made by Luke as an embellishment to his narrative? As we shall see later, there are certain considerations which make it most unlikely, quite apart from Paul's significant omission to say anything about the matter, that Paul was ever a pupil of Gamaliel's.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">We are also told of the young Saul that he was implicated, to some extent, in the death of the martyr Stephen. The people who gave false evidence against Stephen, we are told, and who also took the leading part in the stoning of their innocent victim, 'laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul'. The death of Stephen is described, and it is added, 'And Saul was among those who approved of his murder' (Acts 8:1). How much truth is there in this detail? Is it to be regarded as historical fact or as dramatic embellishment, emphasizing the contrast between Paul before and after conversion? The death of Stephen is itself an episode that requires searching analysis, since it is full of problems and contradictions. Until we have a better idea of why and by whom Stephen was killed and what were the views for which he died, we can only note the alleged implication of Saul in the matter as a subject for further investigation. For the moment, we also note that the alleged implication of Saul heightens the impression that adherence to Pharisaism would mean violent hostility to the followers of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">The next thing we are told about Saul in Acts is that he was 'harrying the Church; he entered house after house, seizing men and women, and sending them to prison' (Acts 8:3). We are not told at this point by what authority or on whose orders he was carrying out this persecution. It was clearly not a matter of merely individual action on his part, for sending people to prison can only be done by some kind of official. Saul must have been acting on behalf of some authority, and who this authority was can be gleaned from later incidents in which Saul was acting on behalf of the High Priest. Anyone with knowledge of the religious and political scene at this time in Judaea feels the presence of an important problem here: the High Priest was not a Pharisee, but a Sadducee, and the Sadducees were bitterly opposed to the Pharisees. How is it that Saul, allegedly an enthusiastic Pharisee ('a Pharisee of the Pharisees'), is acting hand in glove with the High Priest? The picture we are given in our New Testament sources of Saul, in the days before his conversion to Jesus, is contradictory and suspect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">The next we hear of Saul (Acts, chapter 9) is that he 'was still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord. He went to the High Priest and applied for letters to the synagogues at Damascus authorizing him to arrest anyone he found, men or women, who followed the new way, and bring them to Jerusalem.' This incident is full of mystery. If Saul had his hands so full in 'harrying the church' in Judaea, why did he suddenly have the idea of going off to Damascus to harry the Church there? What was the special urgency of a visit to Damascus? Further, what kind of jurisdiction did the Jewish High Priest have over the non-Jewish city of Damascus that would enable him to authorize arrests and extraditions in that city? There is, moreover, something very puzzling about the way in which Saul's relation to the High Priest is described: as if he is a private citizen who wishes to make citizen's arrests according to some plan of his own, and approaches the High Priest for the requisite authority. Surely there must have been some much more definite official connection between the High Priest and Saul, not merely that the High Priest was called upon to underwrite Saul's project. It seems more likely that the plan was the High Priest's and not Saul's, and that Saul was acting as agent or emissary of the High Priest. The whole incident needs to be considered in the light of probabilities and current conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">The book of Acts then continues with the account of Saul's conversion on the road to Damascus through a vision of Jesus and the succeeding events of his life as a follower of Jesus. The pre-Christian period of Saul's life, however, does receive further mention later in the book of Acts, both in chapter 22 and chapter 26, where some interesting details are added, and also some further puzzles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">In chapter 22, Saul (now called Paul), is shown giving his own account of his early life in a speech to the people after the Roman commandant had questioned him. Paul speaks as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">I am a true-born Jew, a native of Tarsus in Cilicia. I was brought up in this city, and as a pupil of Gamaliel I was thoroughly trained in every point of our ancestral law. I have always been ardent in God's service, as you all are today. And so I began to persecute this movement to the death, arresting its followers, men and women alike, and putting them in chains. For this I have as witnesses the High Priest and the whole Council of Elders. I was given letters from them to our fellow-Jews at Damascus, and had started out to bring the Christians there to Jerusalem as prisoners for punishment; and this is what happened....</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Paul then goes on to describe his vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus. Previously he had described himself to the commandant as 'a Jew, a Tarsian from Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city'.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">It is from this passage that we learn of Paul's native city, Tarsus, and of his alleged studies under Gamaliel. Note that he says that, though born in Tarsus, he was 'brought up in this city' (i.e. Jerusalem) which suggests that he spent his childhood in Jerusalem. Does this mean that his parents moved from Tarsus to Jerusalem? Or that the child was sent to Jerusalem on his own, which seems unlikely? If Paul spent only a few childhood years in Tarsus, he would hardly describe himself proudly as 'a citizen of no mean city' (Tarsus). Jews who had spent most of their lives in Jerusalem would be much more prone to describe themselves as citizens of Jerusalem. The likelihood is that Paul moved to Jerusalem when he was already a grown man, and he left his parents behind in Tarsus, which seems all the more probable in that they receive no mention in any account of Paul's experiences in Jerusalem. As for Paul's alleged period of studies under Gamaliel, this would have had to be in adulthood, for Gamaliel was a teacher of advanced studies, not a teacher of children. He would accept as a pupil only someone well grounded and regarded as suitable for the rabbinate. The question, then, is where and how Paul received this thorough grounding, if at all. As pointed out above and argued fully below, there are strong reasons to think that Paul never was a pupil of Gamaliel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">An important question that also arises in this chapter of Acts is that of Paul's Roman citizenship. This is mentioned first in chapter 16. Paul claims to have been born a Roman citizen, which would mean that his father was a Roman citizen. There are many problems to be discussed in this connection, and some of these questions impinge on Paul's claim to have had a Pharisaic background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">A further account of Paul's pre-Christian life is found in chapter 26 of Acts, in a speech addressed by Paul to King Agrippa. Paul says:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">My life from my youth up, the life I led from the beginning among my people and in Jerusalem, is familiar to all Jews. Indeed they have known me long enough and could testify, if they only would, that I belonged to the strictest group in our religion: I lived as a Pharisee. And it is for a hope kindled by God's promise to our forefathers that I stand in the dock today. Our twelve tribes hope to see the fulfilment of that promise.... I myself once thought it my duty to work actively against the name of Jesus of Nazareth; and I did so in Jerusalem. It was I who imprisoned many of God's people by authority obtained from the chief priests; and when they were condemned to death, my vote was cast against them. In all the synagogues I tried by repeated punishment to make them renounce their faith; indeed my fury rose to such a pitch that I extended my persecution to foreign cities. On one such occasion I was travelling to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests....</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Again the account continues with the vision on the road to Damascus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">This speech, of course, cannot be regarded as the authentic words addressed by Paul to King Agrippa, but rather as a rhetorical speech composed by Luke, the author of Acts, in the style of ancient historians. Thus the claim made in the speech that Paul's career as a Pharisee of high standing was known to 'all Jews' cannot be taken at face value. It is interesting that Paul is represented as saying that he 'cast his vote' against the followers of Jesus, thus helping to condemn them to death. This can only refer to the voting of the Sanhedrin or Council of Elders, which was convened to try capital cases; so what Luke is claiming here for his hero Paul is that he was at one time a member of the Sanhedrin. This is highly unlikely, for Paul would surely have made this claim in his letters, when writing about his credentials as a Pharisee, if it had been true. There is, however, some confusion both in this account and in the accounts quoted above about whether the Sanhedrin, as well as the High Priest or 'chief priests', was involved in the persecution of the followers of Jesus. Sometimes the High Priest alone is mentioned, sometimes the Sanhedrin is coupled with him, as if the two are inseparable. But we see on two occasions cited in Acts that the High Priest was outvoted by the Pharisees in the Sanhedrin; on both occasions, the Pharisees were opposing an attempt to persecute the followers of Jesus; so the representation of High Priest and Sanhedrin as having identical aims is one of the suspect features of these accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">It will be seen from the above collation of passages in the book of Acts concerning Paul's background and early life, together with Paul's own references to his background in his letters, that the same strong picture emerges: that Paul was at first a highly trained Pharisee rabbi, learned in all the intricacies of the rabbinical commentaries on scripture and legal traditions (afterwards collected in the rabbinical compilations, the Talmud and Midrash). As a Pharisee, Paul was strongly opposed to the new sect which followed Jesus and which believed that he had been resurrected after his crucifixion. So opposed was Paul to this sect that he took violent action against it, dragging its adherents to prison. Though this strong picture has emerged, some doubts have also arisen, which, so far, have only been lightly sketched in: how is it, for example, that Paul claims to have voted against Christians on trial for their lives before the Sanhedrin, when in fact, in the graphically described trial of Peter before the Sanhedrin (Acts 5), the Pharisees, led by Gamaliel, voted for the&nbsp;<i>release</i>&nbsp;of Peter? What kind of Pharisee was Paul, if he took an attitude towards the early Christians which, on the evidence of the same book of Acts, was untypical of the Pharisees? And how is it that this book of Acts is so inconsistent within itself that it describes Paul as violently opposed to Christianity&nbsp;<i>because</i>&nbsp;of his deep attachment to Pharisaism, and yet also describes the Pharisees as being friendly towards the early Christians, standing up for them and saving their lives?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">It has been pointed out by many scholars that the book of Acts, on the whole, contains a surprising amount of evidence favourable to the Pharisees, showing them to have been tolerant and merciful. Some scholars have even argued that the book of Acts is a pro-Pharisee work; but this can hardly be maintained. For, outweighing all the evidence favourable to the Pharisees is the material relating to Paul, which is, in all its aspects, unfavourable to the Pharisees; not only is Paul himself portrayed as being a virulent persecutor&nbsp;<i>when he was a Pharisee</i>, but Paul declares that he himself was punished by flogging five times (II Corinthians 11:24) by the 'Jews' (usually taken to mean the Pharisees). So no one really comes away from reading Acts with any good impression of the Pharisees, but rather with the negative impressions derived from the Gospels reinforced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Why, therefore, is Paul always so concerned to stress that he came from a Pharisee background? A great many motives can be discerned, but there is one that needs to be singled out here: the desire to stress the alleged continuity between Judaism and Pauline Christianity. Paul wishes to say that whereas, when he was a Pharisee, he mistakenly regarded the early Christians as heretics who had departed from true Judaism, after his conversion he took the opposite view, that Christianity was the true Judaism. All his training as a Pharisee, he wishes to say -- all his study of scripture and tradition -- really leads to the acceptance of Jesus as the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament. So when Paul declares his Pharisee past, he is not merely proclaiming his own sins -- 'See how I have changed, from being a Pharisee persecutor to being a devoted follower of Jesus!' -- he is also proclaiming his credentials -- 'If someone as learned as I can believe that Jesus was the fulfilment of the Torah, who is there fearless enough to disagree?'</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">On the face of it, Paul's doctrine of Jesus is a daring departure from Judaism. Paul was advocating a doctrine that seemed to have far more in common with pagan myths than with Judaism: that Jesus was a divine-human person who had descended to Earth from the heavens and experienced death for the express purpose of saving mankind. The very fact that the Jews found this doctrine new and shocking shows that it plays no role in the Jewish scripture, at least not in any way easily discernible. Yet Paul was not content to say that his doctrine was new; on the contrary, he wished to say that every line of the Jewish scripture was a foreshadowing of the Jesus-event as he understood it, and that those who understood the scripture in any other way were failing in comprehension of what Judaism had always been about. So his insistence on his Pharisaic upbringing was part of his insistence on continuity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">There were those who accepted Paul's doctrine, but&nbsp;<i>did</i>&nbsp;regard it as a radical new departure, with nothing in the Jewish scriptures foreshadowing it. The best known figure of this kind was Marcion, who lived about a hundred years after Paul, and regarded Paul as his chief inspiration. Yet Marcion refused to see anything Jewish in Paul's doctrine, but regarded it as a new revelation. He regarded the Jewish scriptures as the work of the Devil and he excluded the Old Testament from his version of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Paul himself rejected this view. Though he regarded much of the Old Testament as obsolete, superseded by the advent of Jesus, he still regarded it as the Word of God, prophesying the new Christian Church and giving it authority. So his picture of himself as a Pharisee symbolizes the continuity between the old dispensation and the new: a figure who comprised in his own person the turning-point at which Judaism was transformed into Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Throughout the Christian centuries, there have been Christian scholars who have seen Paul's claim to a Pharisee background in this light. In the medieval Disputations convened by Christians to convert Jews, arguments were put forward purporting to show that not only the Jewish scriptures but even the rabbinical writings, the Talmud and the Midrash, supported the claims of Christianity that Jesus was the Messiah, that he was divine and that he had to suffer death for mankind. Though Paul was not often mentioned in these Disputations, the project was one of which he would have approved. In modern times, scholars have laboured to argue that Paul's doctrines about the Messiah and divine suffering are continuous with Judaism as it appears in the Bible, the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, and in the rabbinical writings (the best-known effort of this nature is&nbsp;<i>Paul and Rabbinic Judaism</i>, by W.D. Davies).</span></p>

Did Paul truly stand in the Jewish tradition, or was he a person of basically Hellenistic religious type, but seeking to give a colouring of Judaism to a salvation cult that was really opposed to everything that Judaism stood for?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">As against the conventional picture of Paul, outlined in the last chapter, the present book has an entirely different and unfamiliar view to put forward. This view of Paul is not only unfamiliar in itself, but it also involves many unfamiliar standpoints about other issues which are relevant and indeed essential to a correct assessment of Paul; for example:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Who and what were the Pharisees? What were their religious and political views as opposed to those of the Sadducees and other religious and political groups of the time? What was their attitude to Jesus? What was their attitude towards the early Jerusalem Church?</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Who and what was Jesus? Did he really see himself as a saviour who had descended from heaven in order to suffer crucifixion? Or did he have entirely different aims, more in accordance with the Jewish thoughts and hopes of his time? Was the historical Jesus quite a different person from the Jesus of Paul's ideology, based on Paul's visions and trances?</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Who and what were the early Church of Jerusalem, the first followers of Jesus? Have their views been correctly represented by the later Church? Did James and Peter, the leaders of the Jerusalem Church, agree with Paul's views (as orthodox Christianity claims) or did they oppose him bitterly, regarding him as a heretic and a betrayer of the aims of Jesus?</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Who and what were the Ebionites, whose opinions and writings were suppressed by the orthodox Church? Why did they denounce Paul? Why did they combine belief in Jesus with the practice of Judaism?</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Why did they believe in Jesus as Messiah, but not as God? Were they a later 'Judaizing' group, or were they, as they claimed to be, the remnants of the authentic followers of Jesus, the church of James and Peter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">The arguments in this book will inevitably become complicated, since every issue is bound up with every other. It is impossible to answer any of the above questions without bringing all the other questions into consideration. It is, therefore, convenient at this point to give an outline of the standpoint to which all the arguments of this book converge. This is not an attempt to prejudge the issue. The following summary of the findings of this book may seem dogmatic at this stage, but it is intended merely as a guide to the ramifications of the ensuing arguments and a bird's eye view of the book, and as such will stand or fall with the cogency of the arguments themselves. The following, then, are the propositions argued in the present book:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">1 Paul was never a Pharisee rabbi, but was an adventurer of undistinguished background. He was attached to the Sadducees, as a police officer under the authority of the High Priest, before his conversion to belief in Jesus. His mastery of the kind of learning associated with the Pharisees was not great. He deliberately misrepresented his own biography in order to increase the effectiveness of missionary activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">2 Jesus and his immediate followers were Pharisees. Jesus had no intention of founding a new religion. He regarded himself as the Messiah in the normal Jewish sense of the term, i.e. a human leader who would restore the Jewish monarchy, drive out the Roman invaders, set up an independent Jewish state, and inaugurate an era of peace, justice and prosperity (known as 'the kingdom of God,) for the whole world. Jesus believed himself to be the figure prophesied in the Hebrew Bible who would do all these things. He was not a militarist and did not build up an army to fight the Romans, since he believed that God would perform a great miracle to break the power of Rome. This miracle would take place on the Mount of Olives, as prophesied in the book of Zechariah. When this miracle did not occur, his mission had failed. He had no intention of being crucified in order to save mankind from eternal damnation by his sacrifice. He never regarded himself as a divine being, and would have regarded such an idea as pagan and idolatrous, an infringement of the first of the Ten Commandments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"></span>3 The first followers of Jesus, under James and Peter, founded the Jerusalem Church after Jesus's death. They were called the Nazarenes, and in all their beliefs they were indistinguishable from the Pharisees, except that they believed in the resurrection of Jesus, and that Jesus was still the promised Messiah. They did not believe that Jesus was a divine person, but that, by a miracle from God, he had been brought back to life after his death on the cross, and would soon come back to complete his mission of overthrowing the Romans and setting up the Messianic kingdom. The Nazarenes did not believe that Jesus had abrogated the Jewish religion, or Torah. Having known Jesus personally, they were aware that he had observed the Jewish religious law all his life and had never rebelled against it. His sabbath cures were not against Pharisee law. The Nazarenes were themselves very observant of Jewish religious law. They practiced circumcision, did not eat the forbidden foods and showed great respect to the Temple. The Nazarenes did not regard themselves as belonging to a new religion; their religion was Judaism. They set up synagogues of their own, but they also attended non-Nazarene synagogues on occasion, and performed the same kind of worship in their own synagogues as was practiced by all observant Jews. The Nazarenes became suspicious of Paul when they heard that he was preaching that Jesus was the founder of a new religion and that he had abrogated the Torah. After an attempt to reach an understanding with Paul, the Nazarenes (i.e. the Jerusalem Church under James and Peter) broke irrevocably with Paul and disowned him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">4 Paul, not Jesus, was the founder of Christianity as a new religion which developed away from both normal Judaism and the Nazarene variety of Judaism. In this new religion, the Torah was abrogated as having had only temporary validity. The central myth of the new religion was that of an atoning death of a divine being. Belief in this sacrifice, and a mystical sharing of the death of the deity, formed the only path to salvation. Paul derived this religion from Hellenistic sources, chiefly by a fusion of concepts taken from Gnosticism and concepts taken from the mystery religions, particularly from that of Attis. The combination of these elements with features derived from Judaism, particularly the incorporation of the Jewish scriptures, reinterpreted to provide a background of sacred history for the new myth, was unique; and Paul alone was the creator of this amalgam. Jesus himself had no idea of it, and would have been amazed and shocked at the role assigned to him by Paul as a suffering deity. Nor did Paul have any predecessors among the Nazarenes though later mythography tried to assign this role to Stephen, and modern scholars have discovered equally mythical predecessors for Paul in a group called the 'Hellenists'. Paul, as the personal begetter of the Christian myth, has never been given sufficient credit for his originality. The reverence paid through the centuries to the great Saint Paul has quite obscured the more colourful features of his personality. Like many evangelical leaders, he was a compound of sincerity and charlatanry. Evangelical leaders of his kind were common at this time in the Greco-Roman world (e.g. Simon Magus, Apollonius of Tyana).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">5 A source of information about Paul that has never been taken seriously enough is a group called the Ebionites. Their writings were suppressed by the Church, but some of their views and traditions were preserved in the writings of their opponents, particularly in the huge treatise on Heresies by Epiphanius. From this it appears that the Ebionites had a very different account to give of Paul's background and early life from that found in the New Testament and fostered by Paul himself. The Ebionites testified that Paul had no Pharisaic background or training; he was the son of Gentiles, converted to Judaism in Tarsus, came to Jerusalem when an adult, and attached himself to the High Priest as a henchman. Disappointed in his hopes of advancement, he broke with the High Priest and sought fame by founding a new religion. This account, while not reliable in all its details, is substantially correct. It makes far more sense of all the puzzling and contradictory features of the story of Paul than the account of the official documents of the Church.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">6 The Ebionites were stigmatized by the Church as heretics who failed to understand that Jesus was a divine person and asserted instead that he was a human being who came to inaugurate a new earthly age, as prophesied by the Jewish prophets of the Bible. Moreover, the Ebionites refused to accept the Church doctrine, derived from Paul, that Jesus abolished or abrogated the Torah, the Jewish law. Instead, the Ebionites observed the Jewish law and regarded themselves as Jews. The Ebionites were not heretics, as the Church asserted, nor 're-Judaizers', as modern scholars call them, but the authentic successors of the immediate disciples and followers of Jesus, whose views and doctrines they faithfully transmitted, believing correctly that they were derived from Jesus himself. They were the same group that had earlier been called the Nazarenes, who were led by James and Peter, who had known Jesus during his lifetime, and were in a far better position to know his aims than Paul, who met Jesus only in dreams and visions. Thus the opinion held by the Ebionites about Paul is of extraordinary interest and deserves respectful consideration, instead of dismissal as 'scurrilous' propaganda -- the reaction of Christian scholars from ancient to modern times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">The above conspectus brings into sharper relief our question, was Paul a Pharisee? It will be seen that this is not merely a matter of biography or idle curiosity. It is bound up with the whole question of the origins of Christianity. A tremendous amount depends on this question, for, if Paul was not a Pharisee rooted in Jewish learning and tradition, but instead a Hellenistic adventurer whose acquaintance with Judaism was recent and shallow, the construction of myth and theology which he elaborated in his letters becomes a very different thing. Instead of searching through his system for signs of continuity with Judaism, we shall be able to recognize it for what it is -- a brilliant concoction of Hellenism, superficially connecting itself with the Jewish scriptures and tradition, by which it seeks to give itself a history and an air of authority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Christian attitudes towards the Pharisees and thus towards the picture of Paul as a Pharisee have always been strikingly ambivalent. In the Gospels, the Pharisees are attacked as hypocrites and would-be murderers: yet the Gospels also convey an impression of the Pharisees as figures of immense authority and dignity. This ambivalence reflects the attitude of Christianity to Judaism itself; on the one hand, an allegedly outdated ritualism, but on the other, a panorama of awesome history, a source of authority and blessing, so that at all costs the Church must display itself as the new Israel, the true Judaism. Thus Paul, as Pharisee, is the subject of alternating attitudes. In the nineteenth century, when Jesus was regarded (by Renan, for example) as a Romantic liberal, rebelling against the authoritarianism of Pharisaic Judaism, Paul was deprecated as a typical Pharisee, enveloping the sweet simplicity of Jesus in clouds of theology and difficult formulations. In the twentieth century, when the concern is more to discover the essential Jewishness of Christianity, the Pharisee aspect of Paul is used to connect Pauline doctrines with the rabbinical writings -- again Paul is regarded as never losing his essential Pharisaism, but this is now viewed as good, and as a means of rescuing Christianity from isolation from Judaism. To be Jewish and yet not to be Jewish, this is the essential dilemma of Christianity, and the figure of Paul, abjuring his alleged Pharisaism as a hindrance to salvation and yet somehow clinging to it as a guarantee of authority, is symbolic.</span></p>

<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">Some passages in Paul's Epistles have been thought to be typically Pharisaic simply because their argument has a legalistic air. When these passages are critically examined, however, the superficiality of the legal colouring soon appears, and it is apparent that the use of illustrations from law is merely a vague, rhetorical device, without any real legal precision, such as is found in the Pharisaic writings even when the legal style is used for homiletic biblical exegesis. An example from Romans is the following:</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">You cannot be unaware, my friends -- I am speaking to those who have some knowledge of law -- that a person is subject to the law so long as he is alive, and no longer. For example, a married woman is by law bound to her husband while he lives; but if her husband dies, she is discharged from the obligations of the marriage-law. If, therefore, in her husband's lifetime she consorts with another man, she will incur the charge of adultery; but if her husband dies she is free of the law, and she does not commit adultery by consorting with another man. So you, my friends, have died to the law by becoming identified with the body of Christ, and accordingly you have found another husband in him who rose from the dead, so that we may bear fruit for God. While we lived on the level of our lower nature, the sinful passions evoked by the law worked in our bodies, to bear fruit for death. But now, having died to that which held us bound, we are discharged from the law, to serve God in a new way, the way of the spirit, in contrast to the old way, the way of a written code. (Romans 7: 1-6)</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">The above passage is remarkably muddle-headed. Paul is trying to compare the abrogation of the Torah and the advent of the new covenant of Christianity with a second marriage contracted by a widow. But he is unable to keep clear in his mind who it is that corresponds to the wife and who to the husband -- or even who is supposed to have died, the husband or the wife. It seems that the correspondence intended is the following: the wife is the Church; the former husband is the Torah, and the new husband is Christ. Paul tells us that a wife is released by the death of her husband to marry a new husband; this should read, therefore, in the comparison, that the Church was freed, by the death of the Torah, to marry Christ. Instead, it is the wife-Church that dies ('you, my friends, have died to the law by becoming identified with the body of Christ') and there is even some play with the idea that the new husband, Christ, has died. The only term in the comparison that is not mentioned as having died is the Torah; yet this is the only thing that would make the comparison valid.</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">On the other hand, there is also present in the passage an entirely different idea: that a person becomes free of legal obligations after his or her&nbsp;<i>own</i>&nbsp;death. This indeed seems to be the theme first announced: 'that a person is subject to the law so long as he is alive, and no longer.' The theme of the widow being free to marry after the death of her first husband is quite incompatible with this; yet Paul confuses the two themes throughout -- so much so that at one point he even seems to be talking about a widow and a husband who are free to marry each other and have acceptable children because&nbsp;<i>both widow and new husband are dead.</i>&nbsp;Confusion cannot be worse confounded than this.</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>

The passage thus does not prove that Paul had Pharisee training -- just the contrary. What we can say, however, is that Paul is here&nbsp;<i>trying</i>&nbsp;to sound like a trained Pharisee. He announces in a somewhat portentous way that what he is going to say will be understood only by those who 'have some knowledge of law', and he is clearly intending to display legal expertise. It is only natural that Paul, having claimed so often to have been trained as a Pharisee, should occasionally attempt to play the part, especially when speaking or writing for people who would not be able to detect any shortcomings in his performance. In the event, he has produced a ludicrous travesty of Pharisee thinking. In the whole of Pharisee literature, there is nothing to parallel such an exhibition of lame reasoning.</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#000000" style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large;">What Paul is saying, in a general way, is that death dissolves legal ties. Therefore, the death of Jesus and the symbolic death of members of the Church by identifying themselves with Jesus' sacrifice all contribute to a loosening of ties with the old covenant. This general theme is clear enough; it is only when Paul tries to work out a kind of legal conceit or parable, based on the law of marriage and remarriage, that he ties himself in knots. Thus he loses cogency just where a Pharisee training, if he had ever had one, would have asserted itself; once more, he is shown to have the rhetorical style of the Hellenistic preachers of popular Stoicism, not the terse logic of the rabbis.</span></p>
