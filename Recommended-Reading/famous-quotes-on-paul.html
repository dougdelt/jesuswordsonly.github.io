<h2>Famous Quotes On Paul</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">FESTUS</span>, 59 A.D.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Paul, thou art beside thyself, much learning doth make thee mad." (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+26:24-28&amp;version=NIV">Acts 26:24</a>, Festus.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">CARLSTADT</span>, co-founder in 1517 of Reformation with Luther (who later pushed him out)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It is necessary in fact to preserve compliance to the Lord, and as the <strong><em>Spirit of the Apostles is not a guide equal or greater than the Lord</em></strong>, thus also the<strong><em> heart of Paul within his letters does not have as much authority as has Christ</em></strong>." (Carlstadt, <em>Canonicis Scripturis</em> (1520), quoted in Charles Beard's <em>Martin Luther and the Reformation in Germany</em> (1899) at<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=emIdSf6gTR0C&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;ots=k26bn6FeJ5&amp;dq=carlstadt%20canon%20paul&amp;pg=PA278#v=onepage&amp;q=carlstadt%20canon%20paul&amp;f=false"> 278</a>, discussed in our page <a href="/JWO/carlstadt-research.html">Carlstadt Research</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">JOHN LOCKE, 1696</span>, physician, wrote close commentaries on Scripture, evangelist in <em>Reasonableness of Christianity </em>and famous political theorist who influenced US Constitution.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"It is </span><strong><em>not in the epistles</em></strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> we are to learn what are the</span><em><strong> fundamental articles of faith</strong></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">, where they are </span>promiscuously<span style="font-weight: normal;"> and without distinction </span>mixed with<strong><em> other truths</em></strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">.... We shall find and discern those </span>great and necessary points<strong><em> best in the preaching of our Savior </em></strong><span><strong><em>and the apostles</em></strong></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> ... </span><span><strong><em>out of the history of the evangelists [i.e., the four gospels]</em></strong></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">....</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">If all, or most of the truths </span><span><strong>declared in the </strong></span><strong>epistles</strong>, were to be received and <strong><em>believed as fundamental articles</em></strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">, what then became of those Christians who were fallen asleep (as St. Paul witnesses in his first to the Corinthians, many were) </span><strong><em>before these things in the epistles were revealed </em></strong>to them<span style="font-weight: normal;">? Most of the epistles not being </span><span><strong><em>written till above twenty years after our Saviour’s ascension</em></strong></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">, and some after thirty.... </span><span><strong><em>Nobody can add</em></strong></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> to these fundamental articles of faith." (</span>John Locke, <em>The Reasonableness of Christianity</em><em> </em>(1696) at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZsQYAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Reasonableness%20of%20Christianity&amp;pg=PA154">154 </a> (emphasizing Jesus in the Gospels, and not the epistles of Paul, etc.) For more, see our "<a href="/Recommended-Reading/locke-jesus-over-epistles.html">Locke -Jesus Over Epistles</a>."</p>

If we do not wish to deprive both figures of all historical distinctness, the name 'disciple of Jesus' has little applicability to Paul....

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">HOLGER KERSTEN</span>, 1987, German investigator</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Paul taught that the whole function of Jesus centred on his death which released the faithful from the burden of their sins, their misery and the power of Satan. In fact<strong><em> not a single word Paul wrote in the Epistles gives the actual teaching of Jesus, nor does he mention even one of his parables</em></strong>; instead he spreads his own philosophy and his own ideas.  ***</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The point comes home best when one considers Paul's explicit statement that the human individual can do nothing himself to secure salvation, "Cf. Rom. 3,24; 3,28; 9,11; 9,16; 1.Cor. 1,29; Gal. 2,16). For according to Paul salvation depends solely on the Grace of God." (Eph. 2, 8-9).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Thus the Pauline doctrine makes salvation a one-sided matter for God; people on earth have their hands bound (cf. Rom. 3,24; 4,16; Eph. 2,5; 2,8-9; 2. Tim. 1,9; Tit. 3,5-7). What Paul says here is of course<em><strong> quite attractive, because it is comfortable</strong></em>. By joining the fold, salvation ensues "automatically".<strong><em> No effort on one's own part is then necessary to arrive at the goal of life</em></strong>, for every Christian is saved once and for all by the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross at Golgotha.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It means that one has only to sign up with this 'institution', pay the embership fee', and (lo and behold!) everything is settled for securing a seat in paradise for all eternity. Naturally such a teaching attracted many supporters and spread rapidly. <em><strong>After all it is easier to believe in something that can be had safely and comfortably</strong></em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Simply by the simple act of conversion a person is then redeemed, saved, made a child of God, and becomes a completely new person. According to this teaching,<strong><em> every attempt on one's own part to work towards salvation plays down Jesus' role, is even a deadly sin</em></strong>. And conversely, every person, however exemplary and good his or her life may have been, is declared by his teaching to be lost if he or she does not gratefully acknowledge the sacrifice of the cross as constituting their entire personal salvation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Most Christians think the greatness and uniqueness of Christianity stands and falls with the truth of his teaching. On closer inspection, however, it is found to be <strong><em>a fabrication, far removed from the real ideas of Jesus</em></strong>. There is<em><strong> no hint of the so called Christian doctrine of salvation in the gospels, either in the sermon on the mount - the quintessence of Jesus' message - or in the Our Father, or the traditional parables of Jesus</strong></em>!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Paul is in effect the first Christian heretic, and his teachings, which become the foundation of later Christianity, are a<strong><em> flagrant deviation from the 'Original'</em></strong> or 'pure' form extolled by the leadership. Whether James, the 'Lord's brother,' was literally Jesus' blood kin or not (and everything suggests he was), it is clear that he knew Jesus...personally. So did most of the other members of the community or 'early Church,' in Jerusalem, including of course, Peter. When they spoke, they did so with first hand authority. Paul had never had such personal acquaintance with the figure he'd begun to regard as his 'Saviour.' He had only his<strong><em> quasi-mystical experience in the desert and the sound of a disembodied voice</em></strong>. For him to arrogate authority to himself on this basis is, to say the least, <em><strong>presumptuous</strong></em>. It also leads him to<strong><em> distort Jesus' teachings beyond recognition, to formulate, in fact, his own highly individual and idiosyncratic theology</em></strong>, and then to legitimise it by spuriously ascribing it to Jesus."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"As things transpired, however, the mainstream of the new movement gradually coalesced, during the next three centuries, around Paul and his teachings. Thus, to the undoubted posthumous horror of James and his associates, an entirely new religion was indeed born, a religion that<strong><em> came to have less and less to do with its supposed founder</em></strong>."

Paul, interestingly enough, never mentions Jesus’ interpretation of the [Mosaic] Law, and Paul was quite insistent that<em> keeping the Law would never bring Salvation</em>. The only way to be saved, for Paul, was to trust Jesus’ death and resurrection… Paul transformed the religion of Jesus into a religion about Jesus." (Bart D.
