<h1>The Original Gospel Of Matthew</h1>
<div id="content">

<h2>Final Reconstruction for Devotions</h2>
<p class="intro">It is assumed the reader has read volumes one and two,
and thus already knows that forty-nine times that the leaders of the
Christian church from 125-400 AD quoted what they regarded as the
original </p>
<p class="intro">Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew. Our effort to recreate
the original Hebrew Matthew using these quotes combined with other
ancient sources, we call the Original Gospel of Matthew, or the OGM for
short. </p>
<p class="intro">So if one agrees with the premise of OGM, this final
volume of the three volume series--Final Reconstruction of
Matthew--gives you a version of the OGM you can read for spiritual
devotions. This volume is our best estimation of the likely original.
If you wish to question this, you can still go back to OGM volume one,
and see all the variants that pertain to a passage, and make a
different decision. You can handwrite in your changes, and keep the
OGM: Final Reconstruction which you believe is closest to the original.
The color codes are retained in volume three here to remind you of the
origin of variants we selected. Thus, if you do not agree on using the
Didache, for example, you can simply cross out the matching color-coded
portions in this Devotional Edition. You then will still have a version
which you personally believe is closest to the original Matthew.</p>
<h2>The Color Codes</h2>
<p class="GospHebrews">This color represents the Gospel according to
the Hebrews of Matthew quoted by Jerome, Origen, Justin Martyr
(103-165AD), Eusebius, and the `scholia' of marginal notes left by
scholars on early manuscripts, etc. </p>
<p class="Luke">
This color represents the portions of Luke that Edwards deduces was Luke's effort to use the Gospel According to the Hebrews.</p>
<p class="Agrapha">This color in underline font represents the Agrapha
of Jesus--quotations by respected early church sources of Jesus from a
gospel that is unspecified but which quote cannot be found in the Greek
canon. </p>
<p class="Ebionite">This color represents the Ebionite version of the
Gospel according to the Hebrews of Matthew quoted by Epiphanius, even
though it is likely the same as the Hebrew Gospel of which Jerome,
Origen, Justin &amp; Eusebius identified. Epiphanius was hostile to the
text.</p>
<p class="HebMatt">
This color represents the Hebrew Mathew of Shem-Tob with my own translation or McDaniel's or Howard's translation into English</p>
<p class="HebMatt-yaha">
 For variants in translation by <a href="http://www.scripture.net.nz">http://www.scripture.net.nz</a>, the font changes to
this font.</p>
<p class="Tillet">This color represents the Du Tillet Matthew.&nbsp;<span class="Tillet-cross"></span></p>
<p class="AramaicGosp">
This color represents the Aramaic Matthew.</p>
<p class="Thomas">This color and typeface represents the recently discovered Gospel of Thomas from circa 100 AD when it contains passages almost identical to our Greek canonical Matthew. Other readings of Thomas which are not comparable to the canonical Matthew are not offered for consideration as likely inauthentic. We offer no quote from the Gospel of Thomas of the heretical Naasenes whose Gospel does not match the recently discovered Gospel of Thomas. See Hippolytus ca. 236 AD, Anti-Nicene Fathers Vol.&nbsp;, ch. 2. </p>
<p class="Oxyr">This color with this underline represents Oxyrhyncus
Papyrus 655 discovered between 1897-1907. This fragment is regarded as
a fragment of the "Gospel according to the Hebrews" (per Wikipedia
"Oxyrhyncus Papyrus"). Oxy 655 also overlaps with the Gospel of Thomas,
containing logion 36 to 40 of what was discovered at Nag Hammadi. This
section 655 "seems to belong to a Gospel which was closely similar in
point of form to the Synoptists...and the portion preserved consists
mainly of discourses which are to a large extant parallel to passages
in Matthew and Luke...." (The Oxyrhynchus papyri, Volume 4, Issues
654-839 (edited by Bernard Pyne Grenfell, Arthur Surridge Hunt) (Egypt
Exploration Fund, 1904) at 27.)</p>
<p class="Oxy-840">Oxyrhyncus Papyrus 840, according to Harnack, was
also likely from the Gospel according to the Hebrews. Thus, text in
this font type is from that source.</p>
<p class="Oxyr-all_other">Other Oxyrhyncus papyri from the second or
third century are presumably more authentic, and are included here in
this Type face and font color unless we reject them as likely
inauthentic agrapha.</p>
<p class="GreekVariants">Greek Variants from the earliest sources are
presumably closer to the original source, that is the Hebrew Gospel
written by Matthew. Thus, they are in this font and color.</p>
<p class="Didach">The DidachE which dates between 50 ad and 200 ad
(found in 1875) contains portions that apparently belong to the gospel
according to the hebrews of matthew.</p>
<p class="Coptic">The Coptic Matthew from the Schoyen Collection was
first published in 2001 by Hans-Martin Schenke. The Coptic Matthew
dates to the first half of the fourth century. (Evans: Jewish Versions,
etc.) </p>
<p class="M&uuml;nster">
This is the color for the Sebastian M&uuml;nster edition of a Hebrew Matthew published in 1537 in Latin.</p>
<p class="Codex-D">
Codex D Variants have numerous Semitisms, reflecting a Hebrew or Aramaic underlying more original text. </p>
<p>Any text that is simply underlined represents either (1) an addition
to make the grammar clear; or (2) an insert to express what is clearly
implied or (3) an obvious correction to the Greek translator's work for
reasons set forth in a footnote to the same text in Volume I. If bolded
underlined, it is a question or context postulated as preceding a
statement quoted in the OGM in the early church.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Chapter One</h2>
<p>(1.1)<em class="Tibetan">
 </em>
<em class="Ebionite">
There was a certain man named Jesus about thirty years old</em>,<em class="Tibetan">
 </em>
<em class="Ebionite">
who chose us.</em>
<em class="Tibetan">
 </em>
(1) <em class="HebMatt">
These are the generations</em>
of Jesus, the son of Abraham. (2) Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat
Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren; (3) and Judah begat
Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram;
(4) and Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon
begat Salmon; (5) and Salmon begat Boaz from Rachab the harlot; and
Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; (6) and Jesse begat
David the king. And David begat Solomon of her that had been the wife
of Uriah; (7) and Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah;
and Abijah begat Asa; (8) and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat
begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah; (9) and Uzziah begat Hezekiah;
(10) and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon
begat Josiah; (11) and Josiah begat Jehoiakim and his brethren, at the
time of the carrying away to Babylon. (12) And after the carrying away
to Babylon, Jehoiakim begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel;
(13) and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat <em class="Tillet">
Abner who beget</em>
 Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; (14) and Azor begat <em class="HebMatt">
Z</em>adoc; and <em class="HebMatt">
Z</em>adoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; (15) and Eliud begat Eleazar;
and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; (16) Jacob begot
Joseph. This<em class="GospHebrews">
 </em>
<em class="GreekVariants">
Joseph</em><em class="GospHebrews">
 </em>
<em class="GreekVariants">
begat Jesus who is called the Christ.</em>
(18) Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: (20) Behold, an angel of the Lord, <em class="GospHebrews">
Michael</em>, <em class="GospHebrews">
to whom the Father commended this enterprise</em>, appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, &ldquo;Joseph, you son of David, Mary your wife (21) shall <em class="GreekVariants">
bear</em>
 <em class="GreekVariants">
you</em>
 a son. And you shall call his name Jesus for he shall save <em class="HebMatt">
my</em>
 people from their sins. (22) Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Yahweh</em>
 through the prophet, saying, (23) Behold, <em class="Ebionite">
a young woman</em>
 shall be with child, and shall give birth to a son, And they shall call his name <em class="HebMatt">
E</em>mmanuel; <em class="HebMatt">
that is</em>
 God with us. (24) And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Yahweh</em>
  commanded him, and took to himself his wife. (25) <em class="GreekVariants">
And she bore him a first-born</em>
 <em class="GreekVariants">
son, and he called his name Jesus</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter Two</h2>

<p>(1) Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem, <em class="Tillet">
a city</em>
 of the land of <em class="Ebionite">
Judah</em>
 in the days of Herod the king, <em class="GospHebrews">
Magi</em>
 came to Jerusalem, saying (2) &ldquo;Where is <em class="HebMatt">
the </em>
<em class="AramaicGosp">
infant</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 king</em>
 of the Jews <em class="HebMatt">
who has</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
been born</em>? For we saw <em class="HebMatt-nez">
stars</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nez">
from their rising</em>
 pointing his star <em class="HebMatt-nez">
toward Jerusalem</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
in the east</em>
 and we have come <em class="HebMatt">
with important gifts </em>
to <em class="M&uuml;nster">
adore</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
him</em>.&rdquo;
(3) And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all
Jerusalem with him. (4) And gathering together all the chief priests
and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the <em class="HebMatt">
Messiah</em>
 should be born. (5) And they told him, &ldquo;In Bethlehem of <em class="GospHebrews">
Judah</em>
 for it is written through the prophet, (6) And you Bethlehem, <em class="HebMatt">
Ephratah</em>, land of Judah, <em class="HebMatt">
you are insignificant</em>
 among the <em class="HebMatt">
clans</em>
 of Judah: For out of you shall come <em class="HebMatt">
to me</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
one to be</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
ruler and </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
lord,</em>&nbsp;<em class="AramaicGosp">a king</em>
 of  Israel.&rdquo; (7) Then Herod met in private with the Magi and learned from them exactly what <em class="AramaicGosp">
date </em>
the <em class="M&uuml;nster">
stars</em>
appeared. (8) And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, &ldquo;Go and
search out exactly concerning the young child. And when you have found
him, bring me word, that I also may come and <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
bow down before</em>
 him.&rdquo; (9) And they, having heard the king, went their way. The stars <em class="M&uuml;nster">
which they saw in the east</em>
 were <em class="HebMatt">
going </em>
before them <em class="HebMatt">
until they stopped before</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
the place</em>
where the young child was. (10) And when they saw the stars, they
rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. (11) And they came into the house
and saw the young child with Mary his mother. And they fell down and <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
bowed down before</em>
  him. And opening their <em class="HebMatt">
sacks</em>, they offered him gifts--gold, frankincense and myrrh. (12) And being warned <em class="HebMatt">
by an angel </em>
in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into
their own country by another way. (13) Now when they were departed, an
angel of <em class="HebMatt">
Yahweh</em>
appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, &ldquo;Arise and take the young
child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell
you. For Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.&rdquo; (14)
And Joseph took the young child and his mother to Egypt. (15) And they
were there until the death of Herod that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken through the prophet, saying, &ldquo;<em class="GospHebrews">
Out of Egypt have I called my son</em>.&rdquo; (16) Then Herod, when he saw that he was <em class="AramaicGosp">
outwitted by </em>
the Magi, was very angry, and sent orders <em class="HebMatt">
to all his princes</em>
to slay all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the
borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the <em class="Tillet">
set time</em>
which he had exactly learned of the birth from the Magi. (17) This then
fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet (<em class="Tillet">upon whom be peace</em>
), saying, (18)  &ldquo;A voice was heard in Ramah, Weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; <em class="HebMatt">
etc.&rdquo; </em>
(19) But when Herod was dead, an angel of <em class="HebMatt">
Yahweh</em>
appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, (20) &ldquo;Arise and
take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel:
for they are dead who sought the young child&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; (21)
And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and <em class="HebMatt">
returned to</em>
 the land of Israel. (22) But when he heard <em class="HebMatt">
that Horcanus--his name</em>
 is Archelaus--was reigning over <em class="HebMatt">
Judah</em>
 in the <em class="HebMatt">
place</em>
 of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being <em class="HebMatt">
urged by</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
an angel</em>
 in a dream, he withdrew into the region of <em class="HebMatt">
Gilgal.</em>
 (23) And he came and lived in a city called <em class="GreekVariants">
Nazara</em>
 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet,  &ldquo;<em class="GospHebrews">For He will be called a Nazarene.</em>&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Chapter Three</h2>

<p>(1.1) <em class="Ebionite">In the days of
King Herod of Judea, during the high-priesthood of Caiaphas, a certain
man named John came baptizing with a baptism of repentance in the river
Jordan. He was of the family of Aaron the priest, son of Zechariah and
Elizabeth. And all went out to him.&nbsp;</em>(1) And in those days John the Baptist was <em class="Tillet">
called</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
and he cried</em>
 in the wilderness of <em class="HebMatt">
Judah</em>, saying, (2) &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Turn in repentance, </em>
<em class="Tillet">
repent</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
over your lives</em>
 for the kingdom of heaven is <em class="HebMatt">
about to come</em>.&rdquo; (3) For he was the one spoken about through Isaiah the prophet who said: &ldquo;The voice of one crying in the <em class="HebMatt">
desert.</em>
 Make ready the way of <em class="HebMatt">
Yahweh.</em>
 Make straight <em class="HebMatt">
in the wilderness</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
a path for our </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nez">
God</em>
.&rdquo; (4.1) <em class="Ebionite">
It so happened that John came baptizing, and Pharisees and all Jerusalem came out to him to get baptized</em>. (4) Now John himself had clothes of camel&rsquo;s hair. And he wore a <em class="HebMatt">
black</em>
 leather <em class="M&uuml;nster">
belt</em>
 girdle about his <em class="Ebionite">
waist</em>. And his food was wild honey of the <em class="HebMatt">
forest</em>
 and <em class="GospHebrews">
manna</em>
 which<em class="Ebionite">
 </em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
tasted like sweet </em>
<em class="Ebionite">
pan</em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
cakes cooked in oil.</em>
 (5) Then people went out to him from Jerusalem, and all <em class="HebMatt">
Judah</em>, and all the region around the Jordan. (6) And they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins <em class="HebMatt">
because of his word</em>. (7) But when he saw many of the <em class="HebMatt-nez">
Pharisees</em>
and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, &ldquo;You
offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come<em class="HebMatt">
 from God</em>? (8) <em class="HebMatt">
Produce the fruits of perfect repentance. </em>
 (9) And do not think to say within yourselves, &lsquo;We have <em class="HebMatt">
Abraham</em>
 as our <em class="HebMatt">
Father</em>,&rsquo; for I tell you, that God is <em class="HebMatt">
able to raise up his son Abraham from these stones.</em>
(10) And even now the axe lies at the root of the trees: every tree
therefore that does not produce good fruit is cut down, and cast into
the fire.&rdquo; <em class="HebMatt">
The crowds asked him &ldquo;If so, what shall we do?&rdquo; John
answered them: &ldquo;He who has two shirts let him give to the one who
has none.&rdquo;</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
So the people came to be baptized. </em>
(10.1)<em class="HebMatt">
 Many </em>
<em class="Luke">
soldiers</em>
<em class="HebMatt"> asked him: &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; And he
answered them: &ldquo;Do not be anxious to lay your hands violently
upon any man and do not chastise them. And be</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
pleased with </em>
your <em class="Luke">
wages</em><em class="HebMatt">.&rdquo; </em>
(10.2)<em class="HebMatt">
 All the people were thinking and reckoning in their heart with affection whether John is </em>
the Messiah. (11) But John said, &ldquo;I indeed baptize you <em class="HebMatt">
in the </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nez">
waters</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
  of</em>
 repentance: but <em class="Oxyr-all-other">
the coming one</em>
 is <em class="Oxyr-all-other">
stronger</em>
 than me, <em class="HebMatt-nez">
the latchet of whose sandal I am not worthy to loosen</em>. He shall baptize you in the <em class="HebMatt">
fire of the </em>
Spirit <em class="HebMatt-nez">
of the One who is holy</em>
 (12)  whose fan is in his hand. And he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor. And he will gather his wheat into <em class="HebMatt">
his granary</em>
 but the <em class="HebMatt">
straw</em>
 he will burn up with unquenchable fire.&rdquo; (12.1) Now <em class="GospHebrews">
behold the mother of the Lord </em>
Jesus<em class="GospHebrews">
 and his brothers said to </em>
Jesus,<em class="GospHebrews">
&ldquo;John the Baptist baptizes for the forgiveness of sins. Let us go
and be baptized by him.&rdquo; But Jesus said to them: &ldquo;in what
way have I sinned that I should go and be baptized by him? Unless
perhaps, what I have </em>
just<em class="GospHebrews">
 said is </em>
the sin of<em class="GospHebrews">
 ignorance.</em>&rdquo; (13.1) <em class="Ebionite">
When the people had been baptized, Jesus also came to be baptized by John.</em>
 (15b) <em class="GospHebrews">
And when Jesus was being baptized a great light flashed from the water, so that all who had gathered there were afraid. </em>
(14) <em class="Ebionite">
Then John falling down before Jesus said, &ldquo;I beseech you, Lord, baptize me!&rdquo; </em>
(15a)<em class="Ebionite">
 But Jesus forbade John, saying: &ldquo;Let it be so; for it is fitting that all things be fulfilled.</em>&rdquo; <em class="Tillet">
He thereby gave </em>
John<em class="Tillet">
 permission </em>
to baptize himself.<em class="Tillet">
 And</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nez">
then they immersed him</em>. (16) And Jesus when he was baptized, went up immediately from the water, and the heavens were opened <em class="M&uuml;nster">
over</em>
 him. <em class="GospHebrews">
The whole fount of the Spirit of God descended </em>
out of heaven<em class="GospHebrews">
 </em>
<em class="Ebionite">
in the shape of a dove </em>
and it<em class="Ebionite">
 </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nez">
ministered over him</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
and</em>
<em class="Ebionite">
 entered him</em><em class="GospHebrews">, and a voice from heaven said to Him: &ldquo;My son, in all the
prophets I was waiting for you, that you might come, and I might rest
in you. For you are my rest; and you are my firstborn son who reigns
forever.&rdquo;</em>
 (17) And behold, <em class="Ebionite">
again</em>
 a voice out of the heavens said: &ldquo;<em class="Ebionite">Today I have begotten you</em>. <em class="GospHebrews">
You my son, I bear witness of my joy that this day you have descended from me.</em>&rdquo; (18)<em class="Ebionite">
 And immediately a great light shone around the place, </em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
a fire</em>
<em class="Ebionite">
 </em>
<em class="AramaicGosp">
flashed</em>
<em class="Ebionite">
 </em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
on the water</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
and was kindled in the Jordan River</em><em class="Ebionite">. John, seeing it, said to Jesus, &ldquo;Who are you, Lord?&rdquo; And
again a voice from heaven said to him, &ldquo;This is my beloved Son in
whom I am well pleased. </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nez">
This Son of mine is loved by Me very much, and I am loving and delighting in Him.</em>
<em class="Ebionite">
 </em>
Oh how <em class="GospHebrews">
 the glory of this child pleases me. </em>
Indeed, <em class="M&uuml;nster">this is my beloved son in whom my spirit delights</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2> Chapter Four</h2>

<p>(1) Then was Jesus led up by the <em class="HebMatt">
Holy</em>
 Spirit into the wilderness <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
of Judah</em>
 to be tempted of <em class="HebMatt">
Satan</em>. (2) And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered. (3)  And the tempter came <em class="HebMatt">
near</em>
and said to him, &ldquo;If you are the Son of God, command that these
stones become bread.&rdquo; (4) But he answered and said, &ldquo;It is
written, &lsquo;Man shall not live by bread alone, but <em class="Tillet">
shall live</em>
 by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of <em class="HebMatt">
Yahweh</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo; (5)  Then <em class="HebMatt">
Satan</em>
 took him into <em class="GospHebrews">
Jerusalem.</em>
 And he set him on the <em class="M&uuml;nster">
pinnacle</em>
 of the temple, (6) and said to him, &ldquo;If you are <em class="Tillet">
the Son of</em>
 God, then throw yourself down, for it is written, &lsquo;He shall give his angels charge over you&rsquo; <em class="HebMatt">
to keep you in all your ways</em>
 and, &lsquo;On <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
the palms of</em>
their hands they shall bear you up, so that you will not strike your
foot against a stone.&rsquo;&rdquo; (7) Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Again
it is written, <em class="HebMatt">
you shall not tempt </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
Yahweh</em>,<em class="HebMatt">
 your </em>
God.&rdquo; (8) Again, <em class="HebMatt">
Satan</em>
 took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the <em class="HebMatt">
earth</em>, and the glory of them. (9) And he said to him, &ldquo;All this power
I will give you, and the glory of them. All these things will I give
you if you will fall down and <em class="HebMatt">
bare your head to me</em>.&rdquo; (10) <em class="GospHebrews">
Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Even likewise my mother, the Holy Spirit, compelled me, and carried me to the great Mount Tabor.</em>
 Thus go away <em class="HebMatt">
Satanas</em>
 for it is written, &lsquo;<em class="HebMatt">I will pray to </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
Yahweh</em>,<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
the Lord God</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 and Him only you shall </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
worship</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo; (11) Then <em class="HebMatt">
Satan</em>
 left him. And angels came and ministered to him. (12) Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into <em class="HebMatt">
Gilgal,</em>
  (13) and <em class="HebMatt">
passed by </em>
<em class="GreekVariants">
Nazara</em>&nbsp;<em class="HebMatt"></em>and he came and dwelt in Capernaum-<em class="HebMatt">
Raithah </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
on the outskirts of Zebulun and Naftali. This is a city by the sea,</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
(14) that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah, the
prophet, saying, (15) &ldquo;The land of Zebulun and the land of
Naphtali, <em class="HebMatt">
the way of</em>
 the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, (16) the people who <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
walked</em>
 in darkness saw a great light, and to them that sat in the region and shadow of death, <em class="HebMatt">
a light has shined upon them.</em>&rdquo;<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
(17) From that time Jesus began to <em class="Tillet">
cry</em>
 aloud, &ldquo;<em class="Tillet">Turn! Turn in repentance!</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Turn around </em>
your lives<em class="M&uuml;nster">!</em>
 For the kingdom of the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
approaches</em>
 and is <em class="HebMatt">
near</em>.&rdquo; (18) And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers -- Simon who is <em class="HebMatt">
also</em>
 called <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Kefa</em>
or Peter, and Andrew, his brother. They were casting a net into the sea
for they were fishermen. (19) And he said to them, &ldquo;Come follow
me, and I will make you <em class="HebMatt">
fish for men</em>.&rdquo;  (20) And <em class="HebMatt">
in that hour</em>
they left their nets, and followed him. (21) And going on from there,
Jesus saw two other brothers -- James and John his brother -- the sons
of <em class="Tillet">
Zabdi</em>. They were in the boat <em class="HebMatt">
with</em>
 their father <em class="Tillet">
Zabdi</em>,  <em class="HebMatt">
setting up</em>
 their nets. And Jesus called them. (22) And they <em class="HebMatt">
hastened </em>
and <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
quickly</em>
 left both the<em class="Tillet">ir</em>
 boat and father, and followed <em class="HebMatt">
after</em>
 Jesus.&nbsp;(22.2)<em class="Ebionite">
 Coming to Capernaum, </em>
Jesus <em class="Ebionite">
entered the house of Simon</em>
 <em class="Ebionite">
who is called Peter or </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Kefa</em>, <em class="Ebionite">
and said, &ldquo;As I passed by the lake of Tiberias (that is the Sea of Galilee), I chose out John and James (</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
called Jimi</em>
),<em class="Ebionite">
 sons of </em>
Zabdi<em class="Ebionite">, and Simon, and Andrew, Thaddaeus, </em>
Philip, and Nathaniel<em class="HebMatt-nccg">, son of Ptolemy</em>; <em class="HebMatt">
Thomas</em>, <em class="Ebionite">
Simon </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
the Canaanite</em>; James son of Alphaeus, <em class="Ebionite">
Judas Iscariot; and you Matthew, sitting at the tax office. I called and you </em>
all<em class="Ebionite">
 followed me. You therefore, I want to be the Twelve</em>
 <em class="Ebionite">
 Apostles for a testimony to Israel.</em>
&rdquo; (23)  And Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their <em class="HebMatt">
assemblies</em>, and preaching the <em class="HebMatt">
good gift</em>
 of the kingdom <em class="HebMatt">
of the Heaven</em><em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness <em class="Tillet">
and pain</em>
 among the people. (24) And the report of him went forth among all the<em class="Tillet">
 people</em>: and they brought to him all that were sick, suffering from diverse diseases and those <em class="HebMatt">
terrified by an evil spirit</em>, and <em class="HebMatt">
those who shook, and had palsy; and he healed them. (25) And he was followed by great crowds from Galilee and Kapoli</em>
 and Jerusalem and Judaea and from beyond the Jordan.</p>

<h2>Chapter Five</h2>

<p>(1) And seeing the crowds, he went up into
the mountain. And when he had sat down, his disciples came to him. (2)
And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying, (3) &ldquo;Blessed are
the <em class="HebMatt">
humble</em>
 in spirit. For theirs is the kingdom of the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>. (4) Blessed are those who <em class="HebMatt">
wait</em>
 for they shall be comforted. (5) Blessed are <em class="Didach">
the meek</em>
 for  they shall inherit the earth. (6) Blessed<em class="Tillet">
 are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness. For they shall be</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
satisfied</em>. (7) Blessed <em class="Tillet">
are the merciful </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
for mercy shall be done to them</em>. (8) Blessed are<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 those who </em>
are the <em class="HebMatt">
innocent of heart</em>. For they shall see God. (9) Blessed<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
 </em>
are those <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
who </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
pursue </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Shalom (peace)</em>, for they shall be called sons of God.<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 </em>
(10) Blessed are they that have been persecuted for
righteousness&rsquo; sake. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
(11) Blessed<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
 </em>
are you when men shall <em class="Tillet">
falsely</em>
 reproach you, and persecute you, and falsely say all manner of evil against you, for my sake. (12) Rejoice, and be <em class="M&uuml;nster">
jubilant and exalted!</em>
 For <em class="HebMatt">
very</em>
 great is your reward in heaven. For they likewise persecuted the prophets.&rdquo; (13) <em class="HebMatt">
At that time, Jesus said to his disciples</em>: &ldquo;You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt <em class="HebMatt">
has been neutralized in regard to its taste</em>
 how shall it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be thrown out<em class="Tillet">
side</em>
 and trampled under the feet of men. (14) You are <em class="Tillet">
the</em>
 light <em class="HebMatt">
in</em>
 the world. <em class="M&uuml;nster">
You cannot hide a city situated on a hill</em>. (15) Neither do men light a lamp, and put it <em class="HebMatt">
in a hidden place</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
where it cannot shine</em>
 but <em class="HebMatt">
they put it</em>
 on the <em class="HebMatt">
lamp</em>
 stand, and it shines on all that are in the house. (16) Even so let your light shine before <em class="HebMatt">
every man</em>
 that they may see your good works <em class="Tillet">
to honor</em>
 your Father who is in heaven. (16.1)<em class="Tibetan">
 </em>
<em class="Didach">
Be patient, merciful, harmless, quiet, and good, trembling continually at the words that you have heard.</em>&rdquo; (17) <em class="HebMatt">
At that time, Jesus said to his disciples</em>: &ldquo;Do not think that I came to <em class="HebMatt">
annul </em>
or <em class="M&uuml;nster">
weaken</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
the </em>
Law  or the prophets. I came not to<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
abolish</em>, but to satisfactorily <em class="HebMatt-nez">
perform</em><em class="HebMatt"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span>it</em>. (18) For <em class="HebMatt">
indeed</em>
 I tell you, until the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
s</em>
 and earth pass away, not one <em class="HebMatt">
letter</em>
, <em class="HebMatt">
dot</em>, or <em class="AramaicGosp">
mark</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
shall be abolished from</em>
 the Law <em class="HebMatt">
or the Prophets</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
because</em>
 all things will be <em class="HebMatt">
fulfilled</em>. (19) Whoever therefore shall <em class="HebMatt">
annul </em>
or <em class="M&uuml;nster">
weaken</em>
 one <em class="HebMatt">
word</em>
 of these <em class="Tillet">
least</em>
 commandments, and shall teach <em class="Tillet">
the children of</em>
 men so, shall be called the <em class="M&uuml;nster">
least</em>
 man and <em class="AramaicGosp">
smallest person </em>
by those in the kingdom of the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>. But whoever shall <em class="M&uuml;nster">
do</em>
 and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>. (20) For I tell you,  that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the <em class="HebMatt">
sages</em>
 and Pharisees, you shall not in any way enter into the kingdom of the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>. (21) You have heard it was said to them who lived long ago, &lsquo;You shall not <em class="HebMatt">
murder</em>; and whoever <em class="HebMatt">
murders</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
is guilty of a judgment of death</em>.&rsquo; (22) But I say to you, that everyone <em class="GospHebrews">
who has caused sorrow to the spirit of his brother</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
angers his companion</em>
 shall be in danger of the judgment. <em class="HebMatt">
He who calls his brother a good for nothing shall be guilty of judgment before </em>
<em class="Tillet">
the council of </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
the congregation,</em>
 and whoever shall say, &lsquo;You <em class="HebMatt">
mad</em>
 fool!&rsquo; shall be in danger of the <em class="HebMatt">
fires of </em>
hell. (23) If therefore you are <em class="Tillet">
presenting your </em>
<em class="UnderlineBold">
sacrificial</em>
<em class="Tillet">
 offering</em>
 for <em class="UnderlineBold">
atonement</em>
 at the altar, and there you remember that <em class="HebMatt">
you have an </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
argument</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 with a </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
friend</em><em class="HebMatt">, and he is complaining about you because of this matter</em>, (24) leave there your <em class="UnderlineBold">
sacrificial</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
offering</em>
 before the altar, and <em class="HebMatt">
go </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
first to atone to </em>
<em class="Tillet">
your brother</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
to appease him</em>, and then come and <em class="Tillet">
give</em>
 your <em class="UnderlineBold">
sacrificial</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
offerings</em>
 as gift<em class="HebMatt">s </em>
for atonement.&rdquo; (25) <em class="HebMatt">
Then Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;See that you hasten to </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
atone to</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 your enemy </em>
and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
adversary</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 while you are still walking with him in the way</em>; or <em class="HebMatt">
he</em>
 will deliver you to the judge, and the judge will deliver you to his <em class="HebMatt">
servant</em>, and you are thrown into prison. (26) <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Indeed</em>
 I tell you, you shall by no means come out from there <em class="HebMatt">
until the last piece of money is given</em>. (27) You have heard that it was said <em class="HebMatt">
to those of long ago</em>, &lsquo;You shall not commit adultery.&rsquo; (28) But I tell you, that everyone that <em class="HebMatt">
sees</em>
 a married woman (or,&nbsp;woman) <em class="HebMatt">
and covets her</em>
 has committed adultery with her already in his heart. (29) And if your right eye <em class="HebMatt">
seduces you</em>, pluck it out, and throw it from yourself. For it is better for you
that one of your members should perish, than your whole body should be
thrown into hell. (30) And if your right hand <em class="HebMatt">
seduces you</em>, cut it off, <em class="M&uuml;nster">
and cast it from yourself</em>. For it is <em class="HebMatt">
better for you to lose one of your limbs than lose your whole body in hell.&rdquo; </em>
(31) <em class="HebMatt">
And Jesus said to his disciples</em>: &ldquo;It was said also <em class="HebMatt">
to those of long ago</em>, &lsquo;Whoever shall <em class="HebMatt">
leave his wife and divorces her</em>
 is to give her a certificate of divorce. (32) But I tell you not only that everyone that <em class="HebMatt">
leaves his wife is to give her a  divorce certificate</em>,<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
but also he who fails to do so<em class="HebMatt">
 commits adultery and he who takes her commits adultery.</em>
 (33) Again, you have heard that it was said to them of long ago, &lsquo;You shall not take an oath <em class="HebMatt">
by my Name falsely </em>
but shall perform your oath to <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Yahweh</em>.&rsquo; (34) However, I tell you, do not swear at all <em class="HebMatt">
falsely</em>
 or <em class="HebMatt">
in vain</em>
 neither by the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>, for it is the throne of God, (35)  nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, nor by <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Jerusalem</em>
 for it is the city of <em class="HebMatt">
God</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
in the</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
heavens</em>. (36) Neither shall you swear by your head, for you <em class="Tillet">
have no power to whiten one hair or to turn it black again</em>. (37) But if you want to be believed, your words should be,
&lsquo;Yes, yes; No, no,&rsquo; and whatever is more than these is of <em class="Tillet">
evil</em>. (37.1) <em class="Didach">
You shall not be double-minded nor double-tongued for the double tongue
is a snare of death. your word shall not be false or empty, but
fulfilled by action</em>. (38) You have heard that it was said <em class="HebMatt">
in the</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
Law</em>
 to the magistrates, &lsquo;An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.&rsquo; (39)  But I tell you as individuals, <em class="HebMatt">
do not repay evil for evil</em>
 but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the <em class="HebMatt">
left</em>
 <em class="Didach">
and you shall thus be perfect</em>. (40)  And if any man <em class="HebMatt">
opposes you in judgment</em>
 and <em class="Didach">
takes away your coat, give him also your shirt</em>. (41) And whoever shall compel you to go <em class="HebMatt">
one thousand steps</em>, go with him two<em class="HebMatt">
 thousand</em>. (42) Give to him that asks to borrow from you, and from him that <em class="HebMatt">
wishes to</em>
 borrow of you, <em class="HebMatt">
do not hold back</em>. (42.1) <em class="Didach">
Do not be found holding out your hands to receive, but instead draw your hands inward to give</em>. (42.2) <em class="Agrapha">
For it is more blessed to give than receive</em>. (42.3) <em class="Didach">
And if a man takes away something of yours, do not ask for it back</em>. <em class="Didach">
For the Father desires that gifts be given to all from His riches.
Blessed is he who gives according to the commandmentS, for he is
BLAMELESS. </em>
But<em class="Didach">
Watch out YOU who receive. FOR IF ANYONE RECEIVES HAVING NEED, HE IS
BLAMELESS. bUT WHOEVER DID NOT HAVE NEED SHALL GIVE AN ACCOUNT WHY HE
RECEIVED IT, AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE; AND COMING INTO DISTRESS, HE SHALL
BE STRICTLY EXAMINED CONCERNING HIS NEEDS AND he will not come out FROM
that until HE SHALL HAVE PAID back the last penny. But concerning this
it has been said: let your gifts to the poor stay in your hand long
enough for you to learn to whom to give.</em>&rdquo;<em class="Didach">
 </em>
(43) <em class="HebMatt">
Again Jesus said to his disciples</em>: &ldquo;You have heard that it was said <em class="HebMatt">
to those of long ago</em>, &lsquo;You shall love <em class="M&uuml;nster">
your neighbor</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
hate your enemy</em>.&rsquo; (44)  But I tell you, love your enemies and <em class="HebMatt">
do good to the one who hates you</em>
 and pray for them that persecute you, <em class="HebMatt">
and oppress </em>
and<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="Tillet">
spitefully use</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 you</em>. (44.1) <em class="Didach">
Bless them that curse you, and pray for your enemies and fast for them that persecute you</em>. (44.2) <em class="Oxyr-all-other">
For the one who is far away today, tomorrow will be near you.</em>
 (45) <em class="GospHebrews">
Be kind and merciful, as your Father is kind and merciful</em>. In this way you may be<em class="Tillet">
come</em>
 sons of your Father who is in the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>. For He makes His sun to <em class="HebMatt">
shine</em>
 on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. (46) <em class="Didach">
for what thankS </em>
do you deserve<em class="Didach">
if you love them that love you? Do not even other men do the same? But
Love them that hate you, and YOU shall not have an enemy. </em>
For if you love them that love you, what reward have you? Do not even the <em class="Tillet">
transgressors </em>
do the same? (47)<em class="GospHebrews">
 And if you ask after the Peace </em>
<em class="UnderlineBold">
(Shalom)</em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
 of only your brothers,  what do you exceed </em>
over what others do<em class="GospHebrews">?</em>
&rdquo;<em class="GospHebrews">
  And He said, &ldquo;You never should be joyful except when you behold your</em>

<em class="GospHebrews">
brothers with love</em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">

and<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 </em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
charity</em>. (47.1) <em class="Didach">
You shall not hate any man, but some you shall reprove, and for others
you shall pray, and others you shall love more than YOUR life</em>. (48) <em class="HebMatt">
Be perfect even as your Father </em>

<p>(1.1) <em class="Didach">You shall never
forsake the commandments of the Lord; but shall keep those things which
you have received, neither adding to them nor taking away from them</em>. (1) <em class="HebMatt">
Beware</em>
 that you do not give your <em class="Tillet">
gifts to the poor</em>
 before men <em class="HebMatt">
that they might </em>
<em class="Tillet">
see</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
and<em class="HebMatt">
 praise you</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
If you do,</em>
 you have no reward with your Father who is in the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>. (2) When therefore you <em class="Tillet">
give gifts to the poor</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
do not desire to make a proclamation or </em>
sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the  <em class="HebMatt">
marketplace</em>
 and in the streets, that <em class="HebMatt">
men may see them</em>. <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Indeed</em>
 I tell you, they have <em class="HebMatt">
already </em>
received their reward. (3) But when you <em class="Tillet">
give gifts to the poor</em>, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing (4) that your <em class="Tillet">
gifts to the poor</em>
 may be in secret. And your Father, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
the One </em>
who sees <em class="HebMatt">
hidden things,</em>
 shall repay you <em class="M&uuml;nster">
openly</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
in public</em>.&rdquo; (5) <em class="HebMatt">
At that time Jesus</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
said to his disciples</em>: &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">And when you pray, do not raise your voice</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
do not be like</em>
 the <em class="HebMatt">
sad</em>
 hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the <em class="HebMatt">
courtyards</em>, and <em class="UnderlineBold">
they</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
pray with </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
haughty </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
speech that men might hear and praise them</em>. <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Indeed</em>
 I tell you, they have <em class="HebMatt">
already</em>
 received their reward. (6) But you, when you pray, <em class="HebMatt">
go to your couch </em>
and <em class="HebMatt">
close your doors upon you</em>, and pray to your Father in secret, and your Father, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
the One</em>
 who sees in secret, shall reward you. (7) When praying, do not use <em class="HebMatt">
many words</em>
 as the <em class="HebMatt">
heretics</em>
 do. For they think that they shall be heard for their <em class="HebMatt">
multitude of words.</em>
 (8) <em class="Tillet">
Do not be like them</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
Don&rsquo;t you see that </em>
your Father who is in the heavens knows <em class="HebMatt">
your words</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
what you need </em>
<em class="Codex-D">
before you open your mouth</em>? (9) <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
And so</em><em class="HebMatt">, you shall pray</em>
 &lsquo;Our Father,  <em class="HebMatt">
may Your Name be </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Holy</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 and sanctified</em>. (10) <em class="HebMatt">
May Your Kingdom </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
be blessed </em>
and<em class="HebMatt">
 attain its proper time</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
May your will be done -- </em>
<em class="Tillet">
as</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 in the heaven</em><em class="HebMatt-nccg">s,</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="Tillet">
so</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
be it<em class="HebMatt">
 on earth.</em>
 (11) <em class="GospHebrews">
Give us this day our bread for tomorrow. </em>
(12) And forgive us <em class="HebMatt">
the debt of</em>
 our <em class="HebMatt">
sins</em>, as we <em class="HebMatt">
forgive</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
the debt of those who sin against us</em>. (13) <em class="HebMatt">
And do not lead us into the hands of a test but keep us</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
free</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 from all evil. </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
For yours is the kingdom and the power, and the glory, forever and ever</em>. <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Amen</em>.&rsquo; (14) For if you forgive men their <em class="HebMatt">
sins</em>, your Father in the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>
 will also forgive <em class="HebMatt">
your sins</em>. (15) But if you do not forgive others, neither will your Father forgive <em class="HebMatt">
you</em>
 your <em class="HebMatt">
sins</em>.&rdquo; (16) <em class="HebMatt">
And again He said to them</em>, &ldquo;Moreover when you fast, do not act as the hypocrites <em class="HebMatt">
who make themselves appear sad and who </em>
<em class="Tillet">
disfigure</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 their faces to show their fastings before men</em>. <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Indeed</em>
 I tell  you, they have <em class="HebMatt">
already </em>
received their reward. (17) But you, when you fast, <em class="HebMatt">
wash</em>
 your <em class="HebMatt">
head</em>, <em class="Tillet">
and your face</em>
 (18) that you do <em class="HebMatt">
not appear to men</em>
 to fast, but only to your Father who is in secret. And your Father, who <em class="HebMatt">
is</em>
 in secret, shall reward you <em class="M&uuml;nster">
openly</em>.&rdquo; (19) <em class="HebMatt">
And again he said to them</em>, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">
Don&rsquo;t keep heaping up treasures on earth so that they decay and the grub devour it</em>, and where thieves <em class="HebMatt">
dig</em>
 through and steal. (20) But <em class="HebMatt">
make</em>
 for yourselves treasures in the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>, where <em class="HebMatt">
neither the worm nor grub</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
devours</em>, and where thieves do not <em class="HebMatt">
dig</em>
 through <em class="HebMatt">
and </em>
steal. (21) For where your treasure is, there your heart will also be. (22) The lamp of the body is <em class="HebMatt">
your</em>
 eye<em class="HebMatt">s</em>. If therefore <em class="HebMatt">
your eyes look straight ahead</em>
 then <em class="HebMatt">
your body shall not be </em>
in the<em class="HebMatt">
 dark</em>
  but <em class="Tillet">
shall be </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
full of light</em>. (23) But if your eye <em class="HebMatt">
grows dim</em>, your whole body shall <em class="HebMatt">
become dark</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
And </em>
if the light that is in you <em class="HebMatt">
becomes</em>
 darkness, <em class="HebMatt">
all your ways will be dark</em>.&rdquo; (24) <em class="HebMatt">
At that time Jesus said to His disciples</em>, &ldquo;No man can serve two <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
lords</em>. For either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will <em class="HebMatt">
honor</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
stay close to</em>
 one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and <em class="HebMatt">
wealth</em>. (24.1) <em class="Agrapha">
Except you fast to the world, you shall in no wise find the kingdom of God</em>. (24.2) <em class="Thomas">
If you do not observe the sabbath as sabbath, you will not see the Father.</em>
 (25) Therefore I say to you, do not be  anxious <em class="Tillet">
for your souls in what you shall eat</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
  </em>
<em class="Tillet">
or what you shall drink, or for your bodies in what you shall wear</em>.<em class="HebMatt">
 The soul is more precious than food, and the body </em>
more<em class="HebMatt">
 than clothing</em>. (26) <em class="Tillet">
See</em>
 the birds of the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s. </em>
They do not sow <em class="M&uuml;nster">
seed</em>. Neither do they reap. Nor do they gather into barns. It is your <em class="HebMatt">
exalted</em>
 Father <em class="M&uuml;nster">
of the heavens</em>
 who feeds them. Aren&rsquo;t you <em class="HebMatt">
more precious</em>
 than they? (27) And which of you by being anxious can add twenty inches <em class="HebMatt">
to </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
your height</em>? (28) <em class="HebMatt">
If this is the case</em>, why are you anxious concerning your clothing? Consider the lilies of the <em class="HebMatt">
Sharon </em>
field<em class="HebMatt">,</em>
 how they grow <em class="Tillet">
yet</em>
 they do not <em class="M&uuml;nster">
labor</em>
 or <em class="HebMatt">
weave</em>, neither do they spin. (29) <em class="Tillet">
Of a truth</em>, I tell you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not <em class="HebMatt">
clothed</em>
 like one of these. (30) But if God <em class="HebMatt">
clothes the straw which is in the standing grain</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
fresh</em>
 to-day, and tomorrow it is <em class="HebMatt">
dried up and</em>
 thrown into the oven, <em class="HebMatt">
so </em>
much the more <em class="HebMatt">
shall He</em>
 <em class="Oxyr-all-other">
give you your clothing</em>, Oh you of little faith. (30.1) Thus, <em class="Oxyr">
if you have one garment, what do you lack? Who can add years to your life </em>
by worrying about such things<em class="Oxyr">
? </em>
God<em class="Oxyr">
 Himself will provide you with clothing!</em>
 (31) <em class="HebMatt">
If God so thinks of you</em>, do not therefore be anxious <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
to say</em>, &lsquo;What shall we eat?&rsquo; Or, &lsquo;What shall we drink?&rsquo; (32) <em class="HebMatt">
because all these things bodies </em>
<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
require</em><em class="HebMatt">.</em>
 For your Father <em class="M&uuml;nster">
who is in the heavens</em>
 knows that you have need of all these things. (33) But <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
pray first on behalf of</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 God </em>
and His righteousness, and all these things shall be <em class="HebMatt">
given to</em>
 you. So if you <em class="GospHebrews">
ask for the Great Things, God will add to you the little things</em>. (34) Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow. Tomorrow will be anxious about itself. <em class="M&uuml;nster">
The trouble of today is enough </em>
to care about.<br>

<h2>Chapter Seven</h2>

<p>(1) <em class="Tillet">
Judge not and you shall not be judged</em>. (1.1)<em class="Tillet">
 Condemn not and you shall not be condemned. </em>
(2) For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged, <em class="HebMatt">
and </em>
with<em class="HebMatt">
 what measure you use </em>
to judge, it shall be used <em class="Tillet">
again </em>
to measure you. (3) And why do you see the <em class="Tillet">
splinter</em>
 that is in your brother&rsquo;s eye, but <em class="HebMatt">
do not see</em>
 the beam that is in your own eye? (4) Or how can you say to your <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
fellowman</em>, &lsquo;Permit me to take out the <em class="Tillet">
splinter</em>
 in your eye&rsquo; when there is a beam in your own <em class="HebMatt">
eyes</em>? (5) <em class="HebMatt">
H</em>ypocrite! First take the beam out of your own <em class="HebMatt">
eyes</em>; and then you shall see clearly to remove the <em class="Tillet">
splinter</em>
 from your<em class="HebMatt">
 fellowman&rsquo;s</em>
 eye.&rdquo; (6)  <em class="HebMatt">
Again he said to them</em>, &ldquo;Give not that which is holy <em class="HebMatt">
flesh</em>
 to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine. Otherwise, <em class="HebMatt">
they will chew them</em>, and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
the dogs</em>
 turn and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
tear</em>
 at you. (7) Ask <em class="HebMatt">
from God</em>,
and it shall be given you. Keep seeking, and you shall find. Keep
knocking, and it shall be opened to you. (8) For everyone that keeps
asking shall receive; and he that keeps seeking will find; and to him
that <em class="HebMatt">
calls</em>, it shall be opened. (8.1) <em class="GospHebrews">
He who seeks shall not cease until he finds, and finding he shall marvel, and having marveled he shall </em>
<em class="Thomas">
reach the kingdom</em><em class="GospHebrews">, and having </em>
<em class="Thomas">
reached the</em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
 </em>
<em class="Thomas">
kingdom</em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
 he shall rest. </em>
(9) Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks him for <em class="HebMatt">
a piece of bread</em>, will give him a stone? (10) Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? (11) If you <em class="M&uuml;nster">
who are</em>
 evil <em class="M&uuml;nster">
therefore</em>
 know how to <em class="Tillet">
seek to</em>
 give good gifts among<em class="HebMatt">
 yourselves</em>, how much more shall your Father who is in the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>
 give <em class="M&uuml;nster">
good requests</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
His good spirit</em>
 to them that <em class="HebMatt">
seek</em>
 Him? (12) All things therefore whatever you would that men should do for you, <em class="HebMatt">
do to them</em>. For this is the Law and the <em class="HebMatt">
words of the</em>
 Prophets. Thus <em class="Oxyr-all-other">
as you prove yourself kind, so you will experience kindness</em>. (13) <em class="HebMatt">
At that time, Jesus</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
said to his disciples</em>, &ldquo;Enter in by the narrow gate. For wide <em class="HebMatt">
and deep</em>
 is the gate <em class="HebMatt">
of destruction</em>, and many are they that <em class="HebMatt">
are going through it</em>. (14) For narrow is the gate, and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
strict</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
is </em>
the way, that leads <em class="HebMatt">
straight</em>
 to life, and few are they who find it. (15) Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but <em class="HebMatt">
inside</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
they are as full of deceit as</em>
 ravening wolves. (16) By their <em class="M&uuml;nster">
fruits</em>
 you shall <em class="Tillet">
recognize</em>
 them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of <em class="HebMatt">
briars</em>? (17) Even so, every good tree produces good fruit. But <em class="HebMatt">
every bad</em>
 tree produces evil fruit. (18) A good tree cannot produce evil fruit. Neither can a <em class="HebMatt">
bad</em>
tree produce good fruit. (19) Every tree that does not produce good
fruit is cast into the fire. (20) Therefore by their fruits you shall
know them. (21) Not every who says to me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo;
shall enter into the kingdom of the heaven<em class="HebMatt">s</em>. But he that does the will of my Father who is in heaven <em class="HebMatt">
will enter </em>
<em class="Tillet">
with me into</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 the kingdom of the heaven</em><em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>. (22)  Many will say to me in that day, &lsquo;Lord, Lord, did we not <em class="GospHebrews">
eat and drink in your name,</em>
 and prophesy <em class="HebMatt">
in</em>
 your name, and <em class="HebMatt">
in</em>
 your name cast out demons, and do many <em class="HebMatt">
signs</em>
 and <em class="GospHebrews">
wonders</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
in your name</em>? (23)  And then I will profess to them &lsquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">
I do not know you</em>. Depart from me, <em class="HebMatt">
all</em>
 you that work iniquity.&rsquo;&rdquo; (23.1) <em class="GospHebrews">
And the Master said, &ldquo;If you be with me gathered in my bosom, and
do not the will of the Father who is in the heavens, and you do not
keep my commandments, I shall cast you away, out of my bosom, and say
to you, &lsquo;Depart from me. I know not where you come from, you
workers of wickedness. For if you keep not the lesser mysteries, who
shall give you the greater?</em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 </em>
(24) Everyone therefore that hears these words of mine, and does them,
is like a wise man who built his house upon the rock. (25) And the rain
descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that
house. And it did not fall for it was founded upon the rock. (26) And
everyone that hears these words of mine, and does not do them, is like
a foolish man who built his house upon the sand. (27) And the rain
descended, and the floods came, <em class="Tillet">
and the winds blew, and beat upon the house</em>, and the house fell. And great was its fall.&rdquo; (28) <em class="HebMatt">
While Jesus</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
was speaking these words</em>, the crowds were astonished at his <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
leadership behavior</em>
 (29) for <em class="HebMatt">
he was preaching to them</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
with great power</em>, <em class="Tillet">
as one having ability of his own,</em>
 and not as one of <em class="M&uuml;nster">
the scribes </em>
or<em class="M&uuml;nster">
 the Pharisees</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter Eight</h2>

<p>(1) And when he had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him. (2) And there came to him a leper who <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
bowed unto</em>
 him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, <em class="M&uuml;nster">
if you wish, you can heal me.</em>&rdquo; (3) And Jesus extended his hand, and touched him, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">
I wish  that you</em>
 are made clean.&rdquo; And <em class="M&uuml;nster">
immediately</em>
 his leprosy was cleansed. (4) And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">
Strive vigorously</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
not to tell any man</em>. But go, show yourself to the priest, and offer, <em class="M&uuml;nster">
as a testimony</em>, the gift <em class="M&uuml;nster">
as</em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 Yahweh commanded Moses</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
in your law</em>. (4.1)<em class="Luke">
Now some people were showing up at that very time reporting to Him
about the Galileans whose blood Pilate mixed with the sacrifices. </em>
(4.2)<em class="Luke">
 And answering, Jesus</em>
 <em class="Luke">
said to them, &ldquo;Do you think that these Galileans were worse
sinners than all the Galileans, because they have suffered such things?
</em>
(4.3)<em class="Luke">
 Not at</em>
 <em class="Luke">
all for I tell you that unless you are repenting, you will all likewise
perish. Or those of the eighteen on whom the lookout tower of Siloam
fell and killed them, do you think that these were more debtors than
all the other people dwelling in Jerusalem? Not at all for I tell you
that unless you are repenting, you will all likewise perish.&rdquo;</em>
 (5) And when he entered Capernaum-<em class="HebMatt">
hamartha</em>, a <em class="HebMatt">
captain of hundreds</em>
 came to him, begging him, and saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">My</em>
 Lord, my <em class="HebMatt">
son</em>
 lays in the house sick of <em class="HebMatt">
contraction </em>
and he is <em class="M&uuml;nster">
very</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
weak with the illness</em>.&rdquo; (7) And Jesus said to him: &ldquo;I will come and heal him.&rdquo; (8) And the <em class="HebMatt">
captain of hundreds</em>
 answered and said: &ldquo;Lord, I am not <em class="Tillet">
ready</em>
 that you should come under my roof; but only <em class="HebMatt">
make the decision</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
he</em>
 shall be healed. (9) For I am a <em class="HebMatt">
sinful</em>
 man and <em class="HebMatt">
I</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
am the provost, the one in charge</em>
 and having under myself <em class="HebMatt">
horses and riders, </em>
<em class="Tillet">
valiant men</em>, and I say to this one, &lsquo;Go,&rsquo; and he goes; and to another,
&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; and he comes; and to my servant, &lsquo;Do
this,&rsquo; and he does it.&rdquo; (10) And when Jesus heard it, he
marveled, and said to them that were following him, &ldquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">
Indeed</em>, I tell you, I have not found <em class="Tillet">
such</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
a</em>
 faith in Israel. (11) And I tell you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall <em class="HebMatt">
rest</em>
 with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
the</em>
 heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>, (12)  but sons of the kingdom shall be cast <em class="Tillet">
outside </em>
into the <em class="M&uuml;nster">
outer</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
darkness of hell</em>; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.&rdquo; (13) And Jesus said to the <em class="HebMatt">
captain of hundreds</em>, &ldquo;Go your way.<em class="HebMatt">
 As you have believed, it will be done to you</em>.&rdquo; And the <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
young boy</em>
 was healed <em class="Tillet">
the same hour</em>. (14) And when Jesus had come into Peter&rsquo;s house, he saw the mother of Peter&rsquo;s wife lying sick <em class="Tillet">
in a continual burning</em>
 fever. (15) And he touched her hand, and the <em class="Tillet">
burning</em>
 fever left her. And she arose, and ministered to <em class="Tillet">
them</em>
. (16) And when evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. And <em class="Tillet">
by his word alone cast out the spirits for them</em>, and <em class="HebMatt">
he</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
healed every sickness</em>
 (17) that it might be <em class="Tillet">
established</em>
 which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet <em class="HebMatt">
of blessed memory</em>, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Surely our sicknesses he bore and our pains he suffered</em>.&rdquo; (18) Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave commandments <em class="Tillet">
to go to the other side of the sea</em>.  (19) And there came a <em class="HebMatt">
sage</em>, and said to him, &ldquo;Teacher, I will follow you wherever you
go.&rdquo; (20) And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;The foxes have holes, and
the birds have nests, but the Son of man has <em class="Tillet">
no floor</em>
where to lay his head.&rdquo; (21) And another of the disciples said to
him, &ldquo;Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.&rdquo; (22)
But Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Follow me, and leave the dead to bury
their dead.&rdquo; (23) And when Jesus entered into a boat, his
disciples followed him. (24) And there arose a great <em class="HebMatt">
storm</em>
 in the sea, so much so that <em class="HebMatt">
waves were coming into the boat</em>, and <em class="HebMatt">
the boat was thought to be breaking up</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
but he himself was asleep. </em>
(25) And <em class="HebMatt">
the disciples</em>
 came to him, and <em class="HebMatt">
begged</em>
 him, saying, &ldquo;Save <em class="HebMatt">
us</em>, <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
our  Master</em>; <em class="HebMatt">
lest </em>
<em class="Tillet">
otherwise</em>
 we will perish.&rdquo; (26) And he said to them, &ldquo;<em class="Tillet">
Why are you fearful</em>, Oh you little <em class="HebMatt">
of</em>
 faith?&rdquo; Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea. And<em class="HebMatt">
 immediately </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
the large waves</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 became calm</em>. (27)  And <em class="HebMatt">
when the </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
one-hundred</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
 men who were there</em>
 saw this, <em class="HebMatt">
they</em>
 marveled, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Who is </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
He!</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 This</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
one</em>
 that even the winds and the sea obey him!&rdquo; (28) And when he <em class="HebMatt">
crossed over </em>
to the other side <em class="HebMatt">
of the sea</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
into the </em>
country of the <em class="Tillet">
Girgashites</em>, two possessed with demons met him, coming out of the tombs, and were
very fierce, so that no man could pass by that way. (29) And they cried
out, saying, &ldquo;What have we to do with you Jesus, Son of God? Did
you come here to torment us before the <em class="Tillet">
set</em>
 time?&rdquo; <em class="HebMatt">
Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Come out from there, evil host</em>.&rdquo; (30) Now there was <em class="HebMatt">
near</em>
<em class="Tillet">
by</em>
 them a herd of many pigs feeding. (31) And the demons asked  him, saying, &ldquo;If you cast us out, <em class="HebMatt">
grant us authority to go</em>
into the herd of pigs.&rdquo; (32) And he said to them,
&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; And they came out, and went into the pigs. And the
whole herd rushed down <em class="Tillet">
with a great commotion</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
and slipped off</em>
 into the sea, and perished in the <em class="M&uuml;nster">
sea</em>. (33) And they that fed them <em class="HebMatt">
were afraid</em>
 and fled, and went away into the city, and told everything that had happened to them who were possessed with demons. (34) <em class="HebMatt">
So the whole city was afraid.</em>
 And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him <em class="HebMatt">
not to pass into their border.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter Nine</h2>

<p>(1) And <em class="Tillet">
Jesus</em>
 entered into a boat, and <em class="HebMatt">
set sail</em>, and <em class="HebMatt">
returned to</em>
 his own city Capernaum-by-the-Sea.  (2)  And behold, they brought to him a man sick of <em class="HebMatt">
contractions</em>, lying on a bed. And Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick <em class="HebMatt">
man</em>, &ldquo;<em class="Tillet">My</em>
 son, <em class="HebMatt">
have </em>
<em class="Tillet">
confidence</em>.<em class="HebMatt">
 It is by the faith of </em>
Yahweh<em class="HebMatt">
 that your sins have been forgiven</em>.&rdquo; (3) And certain of the <em class="HebMatt">
sages</em>
 said to themselves, &ldquo;This man blasphemes.&rdquo; (4) And Jesus <em class="Tillet">
perceived</em>
their thoughts and said, &ldquo;Why do you think evil in your hearts?
(5) For which is easier to say, &lsquo;Your sins are forgiven,&rsquo;
or to say, &lsquo;Arise, and walk?&rsquo; (6) But <em class="HebMatt">
to inform you</em>
 that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&rdquo; (then he spoke to the sick <em class="HebMatt">
man</em>), &ldquo;Arise, and take up your bed <em class="HebMatt">
and walk</em>.&rdquo; (7) And the man arose and <em class="Tillet">
walked into</em>
 his house. (8) But when the crowds saw it, they were <em class="HebMatt">
very</em>
 afraid and <em class="AramaicGosp">
struck with awe</em>, and <em class="HebMatt">
praised</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
the Mighty One</em>, who had given such authority to men. (9) **** (10) Then I, Matthew, his disciple <em class="HebMatt">
brought </em>
Jesus<em class="HebMatt">
 to </em>
my<em class="HebMatt">
 house to eat</em>
 and it came to pass, as he sat at meat in the house, many <em class="HebMatt">
affluent sinners were at the table</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
were dining</em>
 with Jesus and his disciples. (11) And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, &ldquo;Why does your Teacher <em class="HebMatt">
sit</em>
 and eat with <em class="HebMatt">
affluent sinners and evil men</em>
?&rdquo; (12) But when <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Jesus</em>
 heard it, he said, &ldquo;<em class="Tillet">There is no need of a physician to heal the healthy but </em>
only<em class="Tillet">
 to heal them that are sick</em>. (13) But go and learn <em class="HebMatt">
that which is written</em>, &lsquo;I desire <em class="Tillet">
loving-</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
kindness</em>, and not sacrifice,&rsquo; for I came not to <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
convert</em>
 the righteous, but to convert sinners <em class="GospHebrews">
to repentance</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo; (14) Then the disciples of John came to him, saying,
&ldquo;Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do
not fast?&rdquo; (15) And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Can the <em class="HebMatt">
friends</em>
 of the <em class="HebMatt">
bridegroom</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
weep and fast</em>
as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the
bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they will fast. (16)
And no man <em class="HebMatt">
wastes</em>
 a piece of <em class="HebMatt">
new</em>
 cloth upon an old garment; for <em class="HebMatt">
the force of the piece stretches the worn out garment</em>, and a worse tear is made <em class="Tillet">
than before</em>. (17) Neither do men put new wine into old wine-skins. For if they do
the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins are ruined: but
they put new wine into <em class="HebMatt">
new</em>
 wine-skins, and both are preserved.&rdquo; (18) While he said these things to them, there came a <em class="HebMatt">
captain</em>
 who <em class="HebMatt">
bowed down to</em>
 him, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Master</em>, My daughter<em class="HebMatt">
 just died</em>, but <em class="HebMatt">
hurry</em>
 and please come and lay your hand upon her, and <em class="HebMatt">
restore her to life</em>.&rdquo; (19) And Jesus arose, and followed him, and his disciples did
likewise. (20) And a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years
came behind him, and touched the <em class="HebMatt">
fringe</em>
 of his garment.  (21) For she said to herself, &ldquo;If I <em class="Tillet">
only </em>
touch his garment, I shall <em class="HebMatt">
immediately</em>
 be made whole.&rdquo; (22) But Jesus turning and seeing her said, &ldquo;<em class="Tillet">Have confidence</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
my</em>
 Daughter. <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
May you have a long life</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
through Yahweh, blessed be He. </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
Your faith has made you whole</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
and thus<em class="HebMatt">
 your healing is because of your faith</em>.&rdquo; And the woman was made whole from that hour. (23) And when Jesus came into the <em class="HebMatt">
captain&rsquo;s</em>
 house, and <em class="Tillet">
saw the pipers and dirge makers</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
many people weeping</em>, (24) he said, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Go outside</em>
 for the <em class="HebMatt">
girl</em>
 is not dead, but she is sleeping.&rdquo; <em class="HebMatt">
But in their eyes he was as one who jests</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
they derided him</em>. (25) But when the crowd was put outside, he entered in, and <em class="Tillet">
took her by the hand</em>, <em class="Tillet">
and said, </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
&ldquo;Young girl, arise!&rdquo;</em>
<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
And the <em class="HebMatt">
girl</em>
 arose. (26) And <em class="HebMatt">
this report</em>
 went into all that land. (27) And as Jesus passed by from there, two blind men <em class="HebMatt">
were begging</em>, crying out, and saying, &ldquo;Have mercy on us, son of David.&rdquo;
(28) And when he came into the house, the blind men came to him. And
Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Do you believe that I am able to do
this?&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord.&rdquo;<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 </em>
(29) Then he touched their eyes, saying,<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 </em>
&ldquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">According to your faith it will be done unto you.</em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 </em>
And thus <em class="HebMatt">
your faith will heal you.</em>&rdquo;<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
(30) And their eyes were <em class="HebMatt">
immediately </em>
opened. And Jesus strictly charged them, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Be careful lest the matter be made known</em>.&rdquo; (31) But they went out, and spread abroad his fame in all that
land. (32) And as they went out, a dumb man possessed with a demon was
brought to him. (33) <em class="HebMatt">
He cast out the demon</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
so that</em>
the dumb man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, &ldquo;Nothing
like this has ever been seen in Israel.&rdquo; (34) But the Pharisees
said, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">In the name of </em>
the prince of <em class="HebMatt">
demons</em>
--<em class="Coptic">
Belseboul</em>
-- he casts out demons.&rdquo; (35) And Jesus went about all the cities and <em class="HebMatt">
regions</em>, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the <em class="HebMatt">
good tidings</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
of the kingdom</em>, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness. (36)
But when he saw the crowds, he was moved with compassion for them,
because they were <em class="HebMatt">
weary</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
lying </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
down</em>, as sheep not having a shepherd. (37) Then he said to his disciples, &ldquo;The <em class="HebMatt">
standing grain</em>
 indeed is plentiful, but the <em class="HebMatt">
reapers</em>
 are few. (38) Pray the Lord of the <em class="HebMatt">
standing grain</em>
 sends <em class="HebMatt">
many reapers</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
to harvest his grain</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter Ten</h2>

<p>(1) And he called to himself his twelve
disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them
out, and to heal all manner of disease and <em class="HebMatt">
every</em>
 sickness and <em class="HebMatt">
every plague</em>. (2) Now the names of the twelve <em class="Tillet">
envoys</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
called </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
Apostles</em>&nbsp;are these: the first, Simon, who is called <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Kefa</em>
 or Peter, and Andrew his brother; James <em class="HebMatt">
called Jimi</em>
 and John his brother, the son of <em class="Tillet">
Zabdi</em>, (3) Philip, and Nathaniel Bar-Tholomew (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, Son of Ptolemy); Thomas, and Matthew, <em class="HebMatt">
a lender for interest</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
and who was a transgressor</em>; James <em class="HebMatt">
Aluphei</em>, and <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Taddai</em>; (4) Sim<em class="Tillet">e</em>on <em class="Tillet">
the merchant</em>
 from <em class="HebMatt">
Canaan</em>, and <em class="HebMatt">
Juda</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
Ascereyotah</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
who delivered him up to death</em>. (5) Jesus sent out these twelve, and charged them, saying, &ldquo;Do
not go into any way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of
the Samaritans. (6) But go rather to those sheep <em class="HebMatt">
who strayed</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
from </em>
the <em class="M&uuml;nster">
family</em>
 of Israel. (7) And as you go, preach, saying, &lsquo;<em class="Tillet">Turn, Turn</em>, the kingdom of the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s </em>
is at hand!&rsquo; (8) Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, <em class="Tillet">
and</em>
 cast out demons. <em class="HebMatt">
Do not take wages</em>. Freely you received. Freely give. For <em class="Tillet">
you received for nothing.</em>
 And <em class="Tillet">
for nothing you shall give</em>. (9) <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Possess neither gold nor silver nor money in your </em>
money <em class="M&uuml;nster">
belts</em>. (10) <em class="Tillet">
Neither pack for your journey</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
a change of clothes</em>
 nor shoes <em class="HebMatt">
nor staff in your hand</em>. For the <em class="HebMatt">
workman is worthy to receive enough for his food</em>. (11) And into whatever city or <em class="HebMatt">
region</em>
 you shall enter, <em class="HebMatt">
ask who is good </em>
and<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="Tillet">
honorable</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 among them</em>, and there live until you leave. (12) And as your enter into the house, <em class="HebMatt">
give them a Shalom</em>, a salutation of Peace, <em class="HebMatt">
saying &lsquo;Shalom to this house, Shalom to all who in dwell in it</em>.&rsquo; (13) If the house is <em class="Tillet">
honorable</em>, <em class="Tillet">
it will return to you your peace,</em>
 that is, your <em class="HebMatt">
Shalom. </em>
(14) But any man who will not welcome you,<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
nor listen to<em class="Tillet">
 the sound of </em>
your words,<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
go out from that house<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
or city,<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
and shake off<em class="Tillet">
 even </em>
the dust of your feet. (15) <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Indeed</em>
 I tell you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in <em class="HebMatt">
that</em>
 day <em class="Tillet">
of doom </em>
and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
judgment</em>
 than for that city. (16) I send you out as sheep among wolves. Be therefore <em class="GospHebrews">
wiser than serpents</em>, and as <em class="GospHebrews">
harmless as doves</em>. (17) But beware of men. <em class="Tillet">
They will</em>
 deliver you up <em class="HebMatt">
in their </em>
<em class="Tillet">
courts</em>, <em class="Tillet">
and scourge you with whips </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
in their houses of assembly.</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
And you shall be led before </em>
(18) governors and kings. <em class="HebMatt">
You will be able to bear witness on my behalf</em>, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. (19) But when they deliver you up, <em class="Tillet">
take no thought</em>
 how or what you will say. In that hour the <em class="HebMatt">
answer</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
you need</em>
 shall <em class="HebMatt">
come to you</em>. (20) For it is not you who speaks, but the <em class="HebMatt">
Holy</em>
 Spirit of <em class="HebMatt">
my</em>
 Father that speaks <em class="HebMatt">
through</em>
 you. (21) And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child, and <em class="HebMatt">
the sons shall rise up against their fathers</em>, and cause them to be put to death. (22) And you shall be<em class="HebMatt">
come a derision and a fright</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
to</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
all the nations</em>
 for my name&rsquo;s sake. But he that endures to the <em class="Tillet">
end</em>, the same shall be saved. <em class="Oxyr-all-other">
As often as you fall, rise up, and you will be saved</em>.&rdquo; (23) <em class="HebMatt">
Again Jesus said to his disciples</em>, &ldquo;But when they persecute you in <em class="Tillet">
one</em>
 city, flee <em class="Tillet">
to</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
another</em>. <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Indeed</em>
 I tell you, you shall not have <em class="HebMatt">
yourselves</em>
 gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes. (24) A disciple is not <em class="HebMatt">
greater than</em>
 his teacher, nor <em class="HebMatt">
is</em>
 a servant <em class="HebMatt">
greater than</em>
 his <em class="HebMatt">
master</em>. (25) It is enough for the disciple that he should be <em class="HebMatt">
like</em>
 his teacher, and the servant <em class="HebMatt">
to be like</em>
 his <em class="HebMatt">
master</em>. If they have called the <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
owner</em>
 of the house <em class="HebMatt">
Baalzebub</em>, that is Lord of Tricks, how much more will they do so to <em class="HebMatt">
the </em>
<em class="Tillet">
children</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
of his household! (26) Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing
covered that shall not be revealed. And nothing hid that shall not be
made known. (27) What I tell you in the darkness, declare it in the
light. And what you hear in the ear, proclaim it <em class="M&uuml;nster">
upon the rooftops</em>.<em class="HebMattCross">
 </em>
(28) And do not be afraid of them who kill the body, but <em class="HebMatt">
have no power</em>
 to kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to <em class="M&uuml;nster">
cause to be perished</em>
 both soul and body in <em class="HebMatt">
hell</em>. (29) Are not two sparrows sold for <em class="Tillet">
the smallest coin</em>? And not one of them shall fall on the ground <em class="M&uuml;nster">
without</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
the will of</em>
 your Father who is in the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>. (30) But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. (31) Therefore do not fear. You <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
man</em>
 are more valuable than <em class="M&uuml;nster">
many</em>
 sparrows. (32) Everyone therefore who shall <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
confess</em>
 me <em class="M&uuml;nster">
in the sight of</em>
 men, I will also <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
confess</em>
 him before my Father who is in the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>. (33) <em class="Tillet">
But whoever shall deny me </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
in the sight of</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heavens.</em>
&rdquo; (34.1) <em class="HebMatt">
In that hour, Jesus said to his disciples</em>: (34.2) <em class="Thomas">
&ldquo;I have come to cast </em>
<em class="Luke">
divisions</em>
 <em class="Thomas">
upon the earth</em>
 -- (35) to <em class="HebMatt">
separate mankind</em>
-- <em class="HebMatt">
the son from his father, and the daughter from her mother</em>. (36) Among <em class="HebMatt">
the enemy</em>
 shall be <em class="HebMatt">
loved ones</em>. (34.3)<em class="Thomas">
For there will be five in a house. There&rsquo;ll be three against two,
and two against three; father against son and son against father. And
they will stand alone.</em>
 (37) He that loves his father or mother more than me or whoever loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy <em class="M&uuml;nster">
of me</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
I am not suitable for him</em>. (38) <em class="Tillet">
And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me, the same is not worthy of me</em>. (39) He that <em class="HebMatt">
loves</em>
 his life shall lose it. And he that loses <em class="HebMatt">
it</em>
 for my sake shall find it. (40) <em class="GospHebrews">
He who hears me, hears Him who sent Me</em>. He that receives you receives me, and he that receives me receives <em class="HebMatt">
the One</em>
 that sent me. (41)  He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive <em class="HebMatt">
a reward of the prophet,</em>
 and he that receives a righteous<em class="HebMatt">
 one</em>
 in the name of a righteous <em class="HebMatt">
one</em>
 shall receive <em class="HebMatt">
the reward of the</em>
 righteous <em class="HebMatt">
one</em>. (42) And whoever shall give a <em class="Tillet">
single</em>
 cup of cold water to drink to one of <em class="HebMatt">
my</em>
 little <em class="HebMatt">
disciples</em>
 in the name of <em class="HebMatt">
my</em>
 disciple, <em class="HebMatt-disc">
 Amen</em>, I tell you he shall in no way lose his reward.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter Eleven</h2>

<p>(1) And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed <em class="HebMatt">
on from there</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
and commanded them</em>
 to teach and <em class="HebMatt">
reprove</em>
  in their <em class="HebMatt">
own</em>
 <em class="Coptic">
synagogues</em>. (2) Now when John heard in the <em class="Tillet">
fortress</em>
 prison about the works of Jesus, he sent <em class="HebMatt">
two of</em>
 his disciples (3) and they said to him, &ldquo;Are you <em class="HebMatt">
the one who is to come</em>,
or should we look for another?&rdquo; (4) And Jesus answered and said
to them, &ldquo;Go and tell John the things which you hear and see: (5)
the blind<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
--they see</em>,  and the lame<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
--they</em>
 walk, the lepers<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
--they</em>
 are cleansed, and the deaf<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
--they</em>
 hear, and the dead--<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
they are now the living</em>, and the poor<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
--they</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
are acquitted</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
made happy</em>. (6) And <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
happy</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
blessed</em>
 is <em class="HebMatt">
the one who</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-disc">
has no doubt about</em>
 me.&rdquo; (7) And as these went their way, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, &ldquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">
What did you go into the desert to see? A reed shaken in the wind?</em>
 (8) But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in <em class="HebMatt">
noble garments</em>? They that wear <em class="HebMatt">
noble garments</em>
are in king&rsquo;s houses. (9) But why did you go out to see him? To
see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet. (10) This
is he, of whom it is written, &lsquo;I send my messenger who shall <em class="HebMatt">
make</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
the</em>
 way <em class="HebMatt">
clear</em>
 before <em class="HebMatt">
me</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo; (11) <em class="HebMatt">
Again Jesus</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
said to his disciples</em>, &ldquo;Truly I tell you, among them that are born of women there has
not arisen a greater one than John the Baptist. (12) And from the days
of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence
and <em class="HebMatt">
has been oppressed. </em>
And <em class="Tillet">
forceful</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-disc">
senseless persons</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
plunder it,</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-disc">
tearing it apart</em>. (13) For  the prophets and the law <em class="HebMatt">
spoke concerning John</em>. (14) And if <em class="HebMatt">
you </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
wish</em>
 to receive it, <em class="HebMatt">
he</em>
 is Elijah that is to come. (15) He that has ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo; (16) <em class="HebMatt">
Again Jesus said</em>, &ldquo;But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like <em class="HebMatt">
lads</em>
 sitting in the marketplaces who call to their companions (17) and say, &lsquo;We <em class="HebMatt">
sang</em>
 to you, and you did not dance; we wailed, and you did not <em class="HebMatt">
weep</em>.&rsquo; (18) For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say,
&lsquo;He has a demon.&rsquo; (19) The Son of Man came eating and
drinking, and they say &lsquo;A gluttonous man and a drinker of wine, a
friend of <em class="HebMatt">
affluent sinners</em>!&rsquo; <em class="HebMatt">
So fools judge the wise</em>. <em class="M&uuml;nster">
But wisdom is proven correct by her children.</em>
&rdquo; (20)  Then began he to reprove the cities where most of his mighty works were done, because they <em class="Tillet">
did not turn from their evil deeds</em>. (21) &ldquo;Woe to you, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Korozin</em>! Woe to you, Beth Saida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and <em class="HebMatt">
Sodom</em>
 which were done in you, they would have repented <em class="Tillet">
from evil</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
long ago</em>
 in sackcloth and ashes. (22) But I tell you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and <em class="HebMatt">
Sodom</em>
 in the day of judgment than for you. (23) And you, Capernaum, shall you be exalted to heaven? <em class="HebMatt">
From there</em>
 you shall go down: for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, <em class="HebMatt">
perhaps</em>
 Sodom would have remained until this day. <em class="HebMatt">
Unto Sheol you will be brought down</em>. (24) But I tell you that it shall be <em class="HebMatt">
easier</em>
 for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.&rdquo; (25) At that <em class="HebMatt">
time</em>
  Jesus <em class="HebMatt">
stood up</em>
 and said, &ldquo;<em class="GospHebrews">
I thank you</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Father</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
Be praised</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
my</em>
 Father, <em class="HebMatt">
Creator</em>
 of heaven and earth, that you did hide these things from the wise and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
prudent</em>, and revealed them to <em class="Tillet">
the lightly esteemed</em>
--<em class="HebMatt">
humble</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
young children</em>. (26) <em class="HebMatt">
Truly this was because it was upright before you, my Father</em>. <em class="Tillet">
Yes, Oh Father, for so was your will before you</em>.&rdquo;  (27) Then turning to the disciples, Jesus said, &ldquo;All things of my Father have been delivered to me. (27.1) <em class="GospHebrews">
I will choose for myself the most worthy.  The most worthy are those whom my Father in the heavens has given me. </em>
(27.2) And no one knows <em class="Tillet">
a</em>
 son except <em class="Tillet">
a</em>
 father. Neither does any know <em class="Tillet">
a</em>
 father except <em class="Tillet">
a</em>
 son, and he to whomever <em class="Tillet">
a</em>
 son <em class="HebMatt">
wants</em>
 to reveal him. (28) Come to me, all you who <em class="HebMatt">
are weary and enduring labor,</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
I will help you bear your yoke.</em>
 (29) Take my yoke <em class="HebMatt">
as your yoke</em>, and <em class="HebMatt-disc">
learn </em>
from me.<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 </em>
And you shall find rest for your souls.  <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Know </em>
<em class="HebMatt-disc">
that</em>
 I am <em class="Tillet">
downcast in</em>
 heart, and <em class="Tillet">
driven </em>
to break up the soil as cattle does for planting of seed.  (30) For my yoke is <em class="Tillet">
gentle</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
soft</em>, and my burden is <em class="Tillet">
easy</em>
 to bear.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter Twelve</h2>

<p>(1) At that <em class="HebMatt">
time</em>
 Jesus went on the Sabbath Day through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears <em class="M&uuml;nster">
of corn</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
from the stalks</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
to crush them between their hands</em>
 and to eat. (2) But the Pharisees when they saw it said to him, &ldquo;Your disciples do that which it is not <em class="HebMatt">
proper</em>
 or <em class="M&uuml;nster">
permitted</em>
to do upon the Sabbath.&rdquo; (3) But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Have
you not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were
with him? (4) How he entered into the house of God, and ate <em class="HebMatt">
from</em>
 the showbread of the <em class="HebMatt">
Presence</em>
 (<em class="HebMatt">that is holy bread</em>) <em class="HebMatt">
which is not to be eaten</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
except by the priests alone</em>? (5) Or have you not read in the  Law that on the Sabbath that the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and yet are <em class="HebMatt">
without sin</em>?&nbsp;(6) But I tell you that the temple <em class="HebMatt">is greater</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">than this </em>
cornfield. So what is lawful in the temple is lawful in this cornfield.
(7) But if you had known what this means, &lsquo;I desire mercy and not
sacrifice,&rsquo; you would not have <em class="Tillet">
condemned</em>
 the innocent. (8) For the Son of Man is <em class="HebMatt-disc">
Master</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
even</em>
 of the Sabbath.&rdquo; (9) And <em class="HebMatt">
it came to pass at the end of the days that</em>
 he departed from there, and went into their synagogue<em class="HebMatt">s</em>. (10) And a man <em class="HebMatt">
was there</em>
 who had a withered hand and asked Jesus, <em class="GospHebrews">
&ldquo;I was a mason, seeking a livelihood by my hands. I beg you Jesus that you restore me to health, that I may not </em>
have to<em class="GospHebrews">
 shamefully beg for food.&rdquo; </em>
And the sages asked Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Is it <em class="HebMatt">
permissible</em>
 to heal <em class="HebMatt">
him</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
in</em>
 the Sabbath?&rdquo; <em class="Tillet">
And they said all of this so that they might accuse him before the court of justice</em>. (11) And he said to them, &ldquo;What man among you, if his sheep falls into a pit <em class="HebMatt">
in</em>
 the Sabbath Day would not grab it and lift it out? (12) <em class="HebMatt">
So much the more is man better than </em>
such a sheep. Thus, it is <em class="HebMatt">
permissible and necessary</em>
 to do <em class="HebMatt-disc">
good</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
during</em>
the Sabbath Day.&rdquo; (13) Then he said to the man, &ldquo;Stretch
out your hand.&rdquo; And he stretched it out; and it was restored
whole as the other. (14) But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel
against Jesus, how they might <em class="HebMatt">
put him to death</em>. (15) <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
And it was after this, because</em>
 Jesus <em class="HebMatt">
knew</em>
 it, <em class="HebMatt">
he</em>
 withdrew from there. And many <em class="HebMatt">
sick</em>
followed him, and he healed them all. (16) And he charged them that
they should not make him known (17) that the word spoken through Isaiah
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
the prophet</em>
 would be fulfilled, who prophesied: (18) &ldquo;My servant whom I <em class="Tillet">
uphold</em>, My <em class="HebMatt">
chosen one</em>
 in whom my soul is <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
delighted</em>, I <em class="Tillet">
have</em>
 put my Spirit upon him, And he shall declare <em class="HebMatt">
justice</em>
 to the <em class="HebMatt">
nations</em>. (19) <em class="HebMatt">
And</em>
 He shall not <em class="HebMatt">
fear</em>
 or <em class="Tillet">
cry</em>
 nor<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
will he <em class="Tillet">
lift up</em>
 his heal to <em class="HebMatt">
run</em>. Neither shall anyone hear his voice in the streets. (20) A bruised reed shall he not break, And <em class="HebMatt">
a dim wick</em>
 shall he not put out<em class="HebMatt-disc">. </em>
<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
He will not fail or be discouraged until he establishes justice in the earth</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
forever</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
according to truth</em>. (21) <em class="Tillet">
And the isles shall wait for his Law</em>.&rdquo; (22) Then one who was blind and unable to speak as well as possessed with a demon was brought to him. Jesus healed him <em class="Tillet">
so that he was able both to speak and see.</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
And the crowds saw </em>
it (23) and were amazed, and said, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Is this not the son of David?</em>&rdquo; (24) But the Pharisees <em class="HebMatt">
were quick to hear this</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
and</em>
 they said, &ldquo;This man casts out demons by <em class="HebMatt">
Baalzebub</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
the</em>
<em class="HebMatt-disc">
 </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
lord</em>
 of the demons.&rdquo; (25) And Jesus knowing their thoughts said to them <em class="HebMatt">
in a parable</em>, &ldquo;Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And every city or house divided against itself <em class="HebMatt">
shall fall</em>. (26) And if Satan casts out <em class="HebMatt">
another</em>
 Satan, he is divided against himself. How then shall his kingdom stand?  (27) And if I cast out demons by <em class="HebMatt">
Baalzebub </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
who belongs to your sons</em>, then why<em class="HebMatt">
 don&rsquo;t your sons cast them out?</em>
 Therefore they shall be your judges. (28) But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then <em class="HebMatt">
truly</em>
 is <em class="HebMatt">
the end of his kingdom come</em>. (29) Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and rob his goods, except he binds <em class="HebMatt">
him</em>
 first? And then he will rob his house.  (30) He that is not with me is against me. <em class="Tillet">
And whoever does not gather with me, the same scatters</em>. (31) Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven <em class="HebMatt">
the sons of</em>
men. However, the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.
(32) And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be
forgiven him. However, whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall
not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world which is
to come. (33) <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
Determine</em>
 whether the tree is good, <em class="HebMatt">
according to good</em>
 fruit; or<em class="HebMatt-yaha"> determine</em>
 whether the tree is corrupt <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
according to</em>
 its <em class="HebMatt">
bad</em>
 fruit. For the tree is known by its fruit. (34) <em class="HebMatt">
Family of vipers</em>, how can you being evil speak good things? <em class="HebMatt">
Surely the mouth awakens, the heart speaks.</em>
 (35) The good man produces out of <em class="HebMatt">
the</em>
 treasure <em class="HebMatt">
of a good heart</em>
 good things. And the evil man produces out of <em class="HebMatt">
the treasure of an evil heart</em>
 evil things. (36) And I tell you that every <em class="M&uuml;nster">
useless</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
idle</em>
 word that men shall speak, they shall give an account in the day of judgment. <em class="Agrapha">
In whatever things I find you </em>
speaking<em class="Agrapha">, in those I shall judge you</em>. (37) For by your words you shall be<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 judged</em>
<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
and by your words you shall be <em class="M&uuml;nster">
condemned</em>.&rdquo;  (38) Then certain of the <em class="HebMatt">
sages</em>
  and Pharisees answered him, saying, &ldquo;<em class="Tillet">Rabbi</em>, we <em class="HebMatt">
wish to </em>
see a sign <em class="HebMatt">
from heaven</em>
 by you.&rdquo; (39) But he answered and said to them, &ldquo;An evil <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
and</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nez">
hypocritical</em>
 generation seeks after a sign. And there shall no sign be given it but the sign of Jonah <em class="Tillet">
the prophet</em>. (40) For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so shall the Son of Man be <em class="HebMatt">
buried</em>
 in the <em class="HebMatt-nez">
belly of the earth. </em>
(41) The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
with</em>
 this generation, and shall condemn it. For <em class="HebMatt">
they turned in repentance</em>
 at the <em class="HebMatt">
words</em>
 of Jonah. <em class="M&uuml;nster">
And behold, one greater than Jonah is here</em>. (42) The queen of<em class="HebMatt">
 Sheba</em>&nbsp;shall rise up in the judgment with this
generation, and shall condemn it. For she came from the ends of the
earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. <em class="M&uuml;nster">
And behold, one greater than Solomon is here.</em>
(43) But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passes
through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it. (44) Then
he says, &lsquo;I will return to my house where I came out.&rsquo; And
when he returns, he finds it empty, <em class="Tillet">
cleaned out with shovels, </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
safe</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
adorned</em>
  and <em class="HebMatt">
ready</em>. (45) Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits more
evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. And the last
state of that man is worse than the first. Even so, it shall happen
similarly to this evil generation.&rdquo; (46) While he was yet
speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, seeking
to speak to him. (47) And one said to him, &ldquo;Your mother and
brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you.&rdquo; (48) But he
answered and said to the one who had spoken to him, &ldquo;Who is my
mother? And who are my brothers?&rdquo; (49) And he stretched out his
hand <em class="Ebionite">
over</em>
 his disciples, and said, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">These are</em>
 my mother and my brothers!  (50) For whoever <em class="HebMatt">
does</em>
 the <em class="Ebionite">
wishes</em>
 of my Father who is in <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
the</em>
 heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
they are</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
my brother and my sister and</em>
<em class="Tillet">
 my</em>
 mother.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter Thirteen</h2>

<p>(1)  On that day Jesus went out <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
from</em>
 the house, and sat <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
on the shore of the sea</em>. (2) And there were gathered around him a great crowd <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
until he needed to enter a boat</em>,
and the crowds stood on the beach. (3) And he spoke to them many things
in parables, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the sower went out <em class="HebMatt">
from his house</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
in the morning</em>
 to sow <em class="HebMatt">
his seed</em>. (4) And as he sowed, some seeds fell <em class="HebMatt">
on the road</em>, and the birds came and devoured them. (5) And others fell upon <em class="HebMatt">
rocks</em>
 where they had not much soil. And quickly they sprang up, because they had no depth of soil. (6) And when the sun <em class="M&uuml;nster">
arose</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
above it became warm</em>, they <em class="M&uuml;nster">
withered</em>. And because they had no root, they <em class="HebMatt">
dried up</em>. (7) And others fell upon the thorns. And the thorns grew up and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
suffocated</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
darkened</em>
 them. (8) And others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, <em class="HebMatt">
the first</em>
 a hundred times, <em class="HebMatt">
the second</em>
 sixty, and <em class="HebMatt">
the third</em>
 thirty. (9) He that has ears, let him hear.&rdquo; (10)  And the disciples came <em class="HebMatt">
near </em>
to him, and said to him, &ldquo;Why do you speak to them in
parables?&rdquo; (11) And he answered and said to them, &ldquo;To you
it is given to know the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
<em class="GospHebrews">
My secret is for me and the offspring of my house</em>. (12) For whoever has <em class="Thomas">
in their hand</em>, to him it shall be given <em class="HebMatt">
again</em>, <em class="Tillet">
and he shall abound</em>. But whoever has nothing, from him it shall be taken away even that <em class="Thomas">
little</em>
 which he <em class="HebMatt">
thinks he</em>
has. (13) Therefore I speak to them in parables because seeing they see
not, and hearing they hear not. (14) And to them is fulfilled <em class="HebMatt">
what was said through Isaiah the prophet</em>: &lsquo;<em class="HebMatt">Go and say to this people, </em>
&ldquo;<em class="Tillet">Hearing</em><em class="HebMatt">, </em>
<em class="Tillet">
you </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
hear but do not comprehend. </em>
<em class="Tillet">
Seeing</em>, <em class="Tillet">
you</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 see</em>
<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
but do not understand.</em>
 (15) <em class="HebMatt">
Make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and blind their eyes, </em>
<em class="Tillet">
otherwise, it sees with its eyes, and</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
hears with its ears, and understands with its heart and returns, and is healed.</em>&rdquo;<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
(16) But <em class="HebMatt">
happy</em>
 are your eyes, for they see. And your ears for they hear.  (17)  For <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Amen</em>
  I tell you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you <em class="Tillet">
are seeing</em>, and saw them not. And to hear the things which you <em class="Tillet">
are hearing</em>, and heard them not. (17.1) <em class="Thomas">
I will give you what no eye has seen and no ear has heard and no hand has touched and what has never arisen in the human heart.</em>
 (18) <em class="HebMatt">
But</em>
 hear then the parable of the sower. (19) <em class="HebMatt">
The Sower</em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">? He</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 is the Son of Man</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
And the seed which fell on the road</em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">? All those</em>
 who hear <em class="Tillet">
the word</em>
 of the kingdom of heaven and do not understand it so <em class="HebMatt">
the Adversary </em>
comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what <em class="HebMatt">
the example</em>
 of the seed sown on the road represents. (20) And he that was sown upon the <em class="HebMatt">
rocks</em><em class="HebMatt-nccg">?</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
He is the one</em>
 who hears the word <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
of the Mighty One</em>, and quickly with joy receives it;  (21) <em class="Tillet">
but is like the seed which has no root</em>
 and is in <em class="HebMatt">
confusion</em>, but endures for <em class="Tillet">
an hour</em>. And when <em class="HebMatt">
a little trouble</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
persecution</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 comes to them</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
because of the word</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
Satan causes them to forget from their heart </em>
<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
the word of the Mighty One</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
and he makes no fruit</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
is offended</em>. (22) And he that was sown among the thorns<em class="HebMatt-nccg">?</em>
 This is he that hears the word, and <em class="HebMatt">
in his desire to gather wealth</em>
-- <em class="M&uuml;nster">
unfair mammon,</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
the Adversary causes him to forget the word of God</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
suffocates the word</em>, and <em class="HebMatt">
he </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
doesn&rsquo;t</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 make </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
any</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 fruit</em>. (23) And he that was sown upon the good ground<em class="HebMatt-nccg">?</em>
 This is he that hears the word, and understands it; who truly bears fruit,<em class="HebMatt">
 that is,  good works</em>, and produces <em class="HebMatt">
from the first</em>
 a hundred times, <em class="HebMatt">
and from the second</em>
 sixty,<em class="HebMatt">
 and from the third</em>
 thirty. <em class="HebMatt">
As for the hundred, this is the one purified in heart and sanctified in
body; as for the sixty, this is the one separated from women. As for
this thirty, this is the one sanctified in matrimony, in body and in
heart.</em>&rdquo;<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
(24) Another parable <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
he placed</em>
 before them, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is <em class="M&uuml;nster">
similar to</em>
 a man that sowed good seed in his field. (25)  However, while his men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also <em class="HebMatt">
over</em>
 the wheat, and went away. (26) But when the <em class="HebMatt">
herb </em>
sprang up and produced fruit, then <em class="HebMatt">
he saw the tares</em>
also. (27) And the servants of the owner of the house came and told
him, &lsquo;Sir, didn&rsquo;t you sow good seed in your field? Why have
tares <em class="Tillet">
come into it</em>
?&rsquo; (28) And he answered them, &lsquo;<em class="HebMatt">My </em>
enemy has done this.&rsquo; And the servants replied to him, &lsquo;<em class="HebMatt">We will uproot the tares.</em>&rsquo; (29) But he said <em class="HebMatt">
to them</em>, &lsquo;No. For <em class="M&uuml;nster">
as you collect the tares</em>, you might at <em class="M&uuml;nster">
the same time</em>
root up the wheat with them. (30) Let both grow together until the
harvest. And in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers,
&ldquo;Gather up first the tares, and bind them in <em class="HebMatt">
individual</em>
 bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; (31) Another parable <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
he placed </em>
before them, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard <em class="Thomas">
seed</em>, which a man took, and sowed in his field. (32) It indeed <em class="HebMatt">
is smaller than all garden herbs</em>. However, when <em class="Thomas">
it falls on the tilled ground, it produces a large branch</em>, and it becomes a <em class="Thomas">
shelter</em>
 for the birds of the sky.&rdquo; (33)  He told them another parable: &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is <em class="M&uuml;nster">
similar to</em>
 leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of <em class="HebMatt">
flour</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
and it leavens all of it.</em>&rdquo; (34) All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the crowds,
and he did not speak anything except parables to them (35) that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
&ldquo;I will open my mouth in parables. I will utter <em class="HebMatt">
riddles</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
enigmas</em>
 from <em class="HebMatt">
ancient times</em>.&rdquo; (36) Then he left the crowds, and went into the house. And his
disciples came to him, saying, &ldquo;Explain to us the parable of the
tares of the field.&rdquo; (37) And he answered and said, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">In this  example</em>, he that sows the good seed is <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
the Son of Man</em>. (38)  And the field<em class="HebMatt-nccg">?</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
It&rsquo;s</em>
 the world --<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
this age</em>. And the good <em class="HebMatt">
fruit</em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">? T</em>hese are the <em class="HebMatt">
righteous</em>. And the tares<em class="HebMatt-nccg">? They</em>
 are the <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
ungodly, </em>
sons of <em class="Tillet">
Belial</em>. (39) And the enemy that sowed them? <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
He</em>
 is <em class="HebMatt">
the Adversary</em>, <em class="M&uuml;nster">
the devil</em>. And the <em class="HebMatt">
standing grain </em>
<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
at the end</em><em class="HebMatt-nccg">?</em><em class="HebMatt-nccg"> It</em>
 is the <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
age</em>
 of the <em class="HebMatt">
world to come</em>. And the reapers<em class="HebMatt-nccg">? They</em>
 are the angels. (40) As <em class="HebMatt">
the reapers gather the tares to burn</em>, so it shall be in the end of <em class="HebMatt">
days</em>. (41) The Son of Man shall send out his angels and they shall <em class="HebMatt">
uproot from</em>
 his kingdom all <em class="HebMatt">
evil</em>
 ones that <em class="M&uuml;nster">
cause offence</em>, and them that do iniquity. (42) And they shall cast them into the <em class="Tillet">
furnace of fire</em>. (43) Then shall the righteous shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears <em class="HebMatt">
to hear</em>, let him hear.&rdquo; (44) <em class="HebMatt">
Again Jesus said to his disciples</em>: &ldquo;The kingdom of <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
the</em>
 heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>
 is like a treasure hidden in the field which a man found, and hid. And in his joy <em class="HebMatt">
over the value</em>
 he went  and sold all that he had, and bought that field. (45) Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a merchant <em class="Thomas">
who possessed merchandise </em>
and was<em class="Thomas">
 </em>
seeking <em class="M&uuml;nster">
to buy good pearls</em>. (46) <em class="Thomas">
The merchant was prudent. </em>
Having found <em class="Tillet">
one precious pearl</em>, he went and sold all his<em class="Thomas">
 merchandise</em>, and bought <em class="Thomas">
the pearl alone</em>.  (46.1) <em class="Thomas">
You, too, are to seek for the treasure that does not fail, that
endures, where no moth comes near to devour and where no worm destroys.
</em>
(47)  Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a <em class="Tillet">
drag </em>
net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind <em class="HebMatt">
of fish</em>
 (48) which, when it was filled, they <em class="HebMatt">
drew it out</em>
 up on the beach. And <em class="HebMatt">
the fishermen</em>
 sat down <em class="Tillet">
on the sea shore</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
chose</em>
 the good <em class="Tillet">
and put them</em>
 into vessels, <em class="M&uuml;nster">
b</em>ut the bad they threw away. (49) So it shall be in the end of <em class="HebMatt">
days</em>. The angels shall come, and <em class="HebMatt">
separate</em>
 the wicked from the <em class="HebMatt">
midst of</em>
 the righteous, (50) and shall throw the wicked into the <em class="Tillet">
furnace</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
of fire</em>. There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
their</em>
teeth. (51) Have you understood all these things?&rdquo; They said,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; (52) And he said to them, &ldquo;Therefore every <em class="M&uuml;nster">
scribe</em>
 or<em class="HebMatt">
 wise man</em>
 who has been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like a man that is a <em class="M&uuml;nster">
householder</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
who brings out of his treasure things new and old.&rdquo;  (53) And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, <em class="Tillet">
he passed over from there</em>. (54) And coming into his own <em class="Tillet">
native land</em>
 he taught them in their synagogue<em class="HebMatt">s</em>, and they were astonished, and said <em class="HebMatt">
in their hearts</em>, &ldquo;From where did this man get this wisdom, <em class="HebMatt">
and</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
power</em>
  to do these works? (55) Is not this the <em class="HebMatt">
blacksmith&rsquo;s </em>
 son? Is not his mother Mary? And his brothers <em class="Tillet">
James</em>, Joseph, and Simon, and <em class="HebMatt">
Judah</em>?  (56)  And <em class="Tillet">
are not</em>
 his sisters <em class="Tillet">
all with us</em>? <em class="HebMatt">
Don&rsquo;t you know all of them among us?</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-disc">
So how did all these things come to this one?&rdquo;</em>
 (57) And they were <em class="HebMatt">
confused about</em>
 him. But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;<em class="Agrapha">
A prophet is not acceptable in his own country, neither does a physician work cures upon them that know him</em>.&rdquo; (58) And he did not <em class="HebMatt">
wish to </em>
do<em class="HebMatt">
 there any sign</em>
 because of their <em class="Tillet">
stubbornness</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
little belief</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter Fourteen</h2>

<p>(1) At that <em class="HebMatt">
time,</em>
 Herod the Tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,  (2)  and said to his servants, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Behold I believe that John the Baptizer is doing these miracles</em>
 and therefore these powers work in him.&rdquo; (3) For Herod had arrested John, and bound him in prison<em class="HebMatt">. This was because </em>
John<em class="HebMatt">
 was reproving him that </em>
Herod<em class="HebMatt">
 should not take as his wife</em>
 Herodias <em class="HebMatt">
because she was</em>
 his brother&rsquo;s wife. (4) John <em class="HebMatt">
was saying</em>
 to him, &ldquo;It is not <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
permissible</em>
 for you to have her.&rdquo; (5) And <em class="HebMatt">
then Herod wished to kill him</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
except</em>
 he feared the people because they believed John was a prophet. (6) But on Herod&rsquo;s birthday,<em class="HebMatt">
 he called the nobles of his kingdom to eat with him, and while they were eating</em>, the daughter of Herod danced among them, and <em class="HebMatt">
it </em>pleased
Herod. (7) He promised with an oath to give her whatever she should
ask. (8) And she, being urged by her mother, said, &ldquo;Give me here
the head of John the Baptist <em class="M&uuml;nster">
on a plate</em>.&rdquo; (9) And the king was <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
very sad</em>. However, because of his oath he made before his dinner guests, he commanded it to be given. (10) And he sent the command <em class="HebMatt">
to kill</em>
 John in the prison. (11) And <em class="HebMatt">
they brought John&rsquo;s</em>
 head <em class="M&uuml;nster">
in a dish</em>, and gave it to the <em class="HebMatt">
girl</em>. And she brought it to her mother. (12) And <em class="HebMatt">
the</em>
 disciples of <em class="HebMatt">
John</em>
came, and took up the body, and buried him. And they went and told
Jesus. (13) Now when Jesus heard it, he left there in a boat, to a
place <em class="HebMatt">
in the </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
desert</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
wilderness of Judah</em>. And when the crowds heard about this, they followed him on foot from <em class="HebMatt">
all</em>
 the cities. (14) And he came out, and saw a great crowd, and <em class="HebMatt">
he extended kindness</em>
 on them, and healed their sick. (15) And when evening had come, the disciples came to him, saying, &ldquo;This place is <em class="M&uuml;nster">
a desert</em>, and it is getting late. Send the crowds away, that they may go into the <em class="HebMatt">
surrounding regions</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
towers</em>, and buy themselves <em class="HebMatt">
necessities</em>
 for <em class="M&uuml;nster">
nourishment</em>.&rdquo; (16) But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;They have no need to go
away. You will give them something to eat.&rdquo; (17) And they said to
him, &ldquo;We have here only five loaves and two fishes.&rdquo; (18)
And he said, &ldquo;Bring them to me.&rdquo; (19) And he commanded the
crowds to sit down on the grass. And he took the five loaves and the
two fishes, and <em class="HebMatt">
as he looked</em>
 up to heaven, he blessed <em class="HebMatt">
them</em>, and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples. And the disciples <em class="HebMatt">
made distributions</em>
 to the crowds. (20) And they all ate the bread, and were <em class="M&uuml;nster">
satisfied</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
They also ate the fish according to what they desired</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
After they finished</em>, that which remained over of the broken pieces of bread was twelve
baskets full. (21) And those who ate were about five thousand men
besides women and children. (22) And soon thereafter he <em class="HebMatt">
commanded</em>
 the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go ahead of him <em class="HebMatt">
to the city to which the crowds were going</em>. (23) And after he had <em class="HebMatt">
left</em>
 the crowds, he went up into the mountain to pray <em class="HebMatt">
alone.</em>
 And when evening had come, he was <em class="HebMatt">
standing</em>
 there alone. (24) But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, <em class="HebMatt">
being driven</em>
by the waves because the wind was against them. (25) About three
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he came to them, walking upon the <em class="Coptic">
waters of the</em>
 sea. (26) And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were <em class="HebMatt">
alarmed</em>, saying, &ldquo;It is a <em class="M&uuml;nster">
phantom</em>
 or a <em class="HebMatt">
demon</em>.&rdquo; And they cried out<em class="HebMatt">
 from the greatness of their</em>
 fear. (27) But right then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">
Let faith be among you!</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Rest assured</em>
 it is I. <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Do not</em>
 be afraid!&rdquo; (28) And Peter <em class="HebMatt">
answered him and said to him, &ldquo;Master, if it is you, command me to come </em>
<em class="Tillet">
over </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
to you on the water</em>.&rdquo; (29) Jesus<em class="HebMatt">
 said </em>
&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; So Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus. (30) But when he saw <em class="HebMatt">
the </em>
<em class="Tillet">
boisterous</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
strength of</em>
 the wind, he was afraid <em class="Tillet">
that he should sink</em>; and he cried out, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt-yaha">My</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
Master</em>, save me.&rdquo; (31) And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and said to him, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Man of</em>
 little<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
belief</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
why</em>
 did you doubt?&rdquo;  (32) And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind <em class="Tillet">
immediately</em>
 ceased. (33) And they that were in the boat  <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
bowed down before</em>
 him, saying, &ldquo;Truly you are the Son of the <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
Mighty One</em>.&rdquo; (34) <em class="Tillet">
And they departed from over the sea, and came into the land of Genossar.</em>
 (35) And when the men of that place <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
recognized</em>
 him, they went into all the surrounding region and brought to him all that were sick <em class="HebMatt">
with various kinds of diseases</em>. (36) And they <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
implored</em>
 him that they might only touch the border of his garment. And as many as touched <em class="HebMatt">
him </em>
were <em class="Tillet">
delivered</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter Fifteen</h2>

<p>(1) Then Pharisees and <em class="HebMatt">
sages</em>
 came to Jesus  saying, (2) &ldquo;Why do your disciples transgress the <em class="HebMatt">
ordinances</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
traditions</em>
 of <em class="HebMatt">
antiquity</em>? For they do not wash  their hands <em class="HebMatt">
before eating</em>.&rdquo; (3)  And he answered and said to them, &ldquo;Why do you also transgress the <em class="Tillet">
commandments</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
words</em>
 of God, <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
the Mighty One,</em>
 because of your  <em class="HebMatt">
ordinances</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
tradition</em>? (4) <em class="Tillet">
Is it not written in your Law from the mouth of God</em>, &lsquo;Honor your father and your mother: and, He that <em class="Tillet">
curses</em>
 or <em class="HebMatt">
smites</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
his</em>
 father or mother, <em class="HebMatt">
will surely be put to death</em>&rsquo;? (5) But <em class="GospHebrews">
you say, &lsquo;Whoever can say to his father or his mother </em>
in financial need<em class="GospHebrews">, &ldquo;Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me was already given as </em>
money donated to the Temple treasury,<em class="GospHebrews"> &nbsp;</em>then<em class="GospHebrews">
 he does not </em>
supposedly<em class="GospHebrews">
 have to honor his father or mother.&rsquo; </em>
Thus you make<em class="GospHebrews">
 </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
any donation </em>
at the temple<em class="HebMatt">
 he might give </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
for the sake of himself</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 as a sinner </em>
able to wipe out<em class="HebMatt">
 this iniquity </em>
against his parents.<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
It<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
is </em>
supposedly<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 forgiven</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
and<em class="HebMatt">
 will be removed from</em>
 him. <em class="GospHebrews">
You have thus made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
(6)  <em class="HebMatt">
So he does</em>
 not honor his father <em class="HebMatt">
and his mother</em>
 by helping them in their financial need, and so you <em class="Tillet">
have </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
despised</em>
 the word<em class="HebMatt">s</em>
 of God, <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
the Mighty One,</em>
 because of your <em class="AramaicGosp">
tradition</em>. (7) You hypocrites! Isaiah did correctly prophesy of you, saying, (8)  &lsquo;<em class="HebMatt">Thus Yahweh says</em>: &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">This </em>
people<em class="HebMatt">
 has come near me </em>
<em class="Tillet">
with</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 their mouth </em>
<em class="Tillet">
and lips</em>, but their heart is far from me (9) <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
and their </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
reverence toward me </em>
<em class="Tillet">
has become </em>
the observance of<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 commandments taught by men.</em>&rdquo;&rsquo; (10) And Jesus called to him the crowd, and said to them, &ldquo;Hear and <em class="Tillet">
know</em>!  (11)  It is not that which enters into the mouth which <em class="HebMatt">
soils </em>
and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
defiles</em>
 the man. Rather, it is that which comes out of the mouth that <em class="M&uuml;nster">
renders impure</em>
 the man.&rdquo; (12) Then came the disciples, and said to him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you realize that the Pharisees were <em class="HebMatt">
perplexed</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
annoyed</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
by this word</em>
when they heard this saying?&rdquo; (13) But he answered and said,
&ldquo;Every plant which my heavenly Father did not plant shall be <em class="Tillet">
rooted up</em>. (14) <em class="HebMatt">
Leave</em>
 them alone. The blind <em class="HebMatt">
are leading</em>
 the blind, <em class="HebMatt">
and if a blind man leads another blind man</em>, both shall fall into a <em class="Tillet">
ditch</em>.&rdquo; (15) And Peter answered and said to him, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt-yaha">My Master</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
explain </em>
to us the <em class="HebMatt">
riddle</em>.&rdquo; (16) And he said, &ldquo;Are you also still without <em class="M&uuml;nster">
any understanding</em>? (17) Don&rsquo;t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, <em class="HebMatt">
and goes on to the natural place?</em>
 (18) But the things which come out of the mouth are<em class="HebMatt">
 moved by</em>
 the heart. And they are what <em class="HebMatt">
soils</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
defiles</em>
 the man. (19) For out of the <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
soiled </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
defiled</em>
 heart comes evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, <em class="HebMatt">
the</em>
 witness<em class="HebMatt">
 of liars,</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
curses</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
blasphemies</em>. (20) These things <em class="HebMatt">
soil</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
render iniquitous</em>
 the man. However, to eat with unwashed hands does not <em class="HebMatt">
soil</em>
 or <em class="M&uuml;nster">
defile</em>
 the man. (20.1) <em class="Didach">
Yet abstain by all means from meat sacrificed to idols; for it is the worship of dead gods</em>.&rdquo; (21) And Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon. (22) And a Canaanite <em class="Tillet">
merchant</em>
  woman <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
who</em>
 came out from <em class="HebMatt">
the lands of the east</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
was crying</em>, saying, &ldquo;Have mercy on me, Oh <em class="HebMatt">
Master</em>, you son of David. My daughter is tormented by demon<em class="HebMatt">s</em>.&rdquo;  (23) But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and asked him, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt-nccg">Our Master, </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
why do you abandon this woman who is crying out after us?</em>&rdquo; (24) But he answered and said, &ldquo;I was only sent to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel.&rdquo; (25) But she came and <em class="Tillet">
prostrated herself to the ground before him</em>, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt-nccg">Master</em>, help me.&rdquo; (26)  And he answered and said, &ldquo;It is not <em class="HebMatt">
good that a man</em>
 take bread <em class="HebMatt">
from</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
his</em>
 children and cast it to the dogs.&rdquo; (27) But she said, &ldquo;<em class="Tillet">That&rsquo;s certainly true, Lord</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
but</em>
 even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall <em class="Tillet">
under</em>
 their master&rsquo;s table.&rdquo; (28) Then Jesus answered and said to her, &ldquo;Woman, <em class="Tillet">
how</em>
 great is your <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
belief</em>. What you <em class="HebMatt">
asked </em>
will be done to you even as <em class="Tillet">
it is in your heart</em>
 to be done.&rdquo; And her daughter was healed from that hour. (29) And Jesus departed there, and <em class="HebMatt">
he went to the region across Galilee to a mountain</em>. And he went up on the mountain, and as <em class="HebMatt">
he stood</em>
 there (30) <em class="HebMatt">
he saw many people</em>
 having with them the lame, <em class="HebMatt">
leprous</em>, maimed, and many others. And they threw them<em class="HebMatt">
selves</em>
down at his feet, and he healed them. (31) As a result, the crowd
wondered when they saw those who hadn&rsquo;t been able to speak were
speaking, and <em class="Tillet">
the </em>
crippled were walking, and the blind could see again. And <em class="HebMatt">
all of them</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
magnified</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
the</em>
 God <em class="Tillet">
of Israel</em>. (32) And Jesus called his disciples, and said, &ldquo;I have compassion <em class="Tillet">
for the </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
crowds</em>
 because they continue with me now <em class="HebMatt">
two</em>
 days <em class="HebMatt">
since they came across</em>
 and have nothing to eat. And <em class="Tillet">
I will not let them go fasting</em>, and they faint <em class="HebMatt">
away</em>.&rdquo; (33) And the disciples asked him, &ldquo;Where will we get so many loaves in a desert place to <em class="Tillet">
satisfy this people</em>
?&rdquo; (34) And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;How many loaves <em class="Tillet">
of bread</em>
 do you have?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Seven and a few <em class="Tillet">
small</em>
  fishes.&rdquo; (35) And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the <em class="HebMatt">
grass</em>. (36) And he took the seven loaves, and he <em class="Tillet">
gave thanks</em>
 and broke them in pieces, and gave the pieces to the disciples, and the disciples then gave them to the  <em class="Tillet">
people</em>. (37) And they all ate, and were filled. And they took up seven
baskets full of that which remained over of the broken pieces. (38) And
they who ate were four thousand men besides women and children. (39)
And he sent away the crowds, and entered into the boat, and came into
the borders of <em class="HebMatt">
Magdula</em>. </p>

<h2>Chapter Sixteen</h2>

<p>(1) <em class="HebMatt">
Sages</em>
 and Pharisees <em class="Tillet">
and Zadducees</em>
 came, and <em class="HebMatt">
tempted</em>
 him by asking him to show them a <em class="Tillet">
single</em>
 sign from heaven. (2) **** (3) **** Jesus said: &ldquo;You know<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
how<em class="Tillet">
 to judge</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
the <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
face of </em>
the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>
 <em class="Thomas">
and the earth, but you have not known what is ahead of you. You do not know how to test this time </em>
and thus<em class="Tillet">
 you cannot discern</em>
 the signs of the times. (4) <em class="HebMatt">
The offspring of</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
evildoers</em>
 seek after a sign. And no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah <em class="HebMatt">
the Prophet</em>.&rdquo; And he left them, and <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
walked away</em>. (5) And <em class="HebMatt">
when Jesus</em>
 came to the <em class="HebMatt">
sea shore</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
he told his  disciples to prepare bread. Then he entered a boat with his disciples, </em>
but<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
the disciples forgot to take bread. (7)***(8) <em class="HebMatt">
Jesus </em>
then<em class="HebMatt">
 said to them, &ldquo;You have little understanding if you think you have no bread.</em>
(9) Don&rsquo;t you yet understand or remember the five loaves for the
five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered up afterwards? (10)
Don&rsquo;t you remember the <em class="M&uuml;nster">
seven</em>
 loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered up afterwards?&rdquo; (10.1)[old 6]<em class="Tillet">
 And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&rdquo; </em>
(10.2)[old 7]<em class="Tillet">
 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, &ldquo;Is it because we took no bread?&rdquo;  And when Jesus knew </em>
their thoughts,<em class="Tillet">
 he said &ldquo;What are you thinking, you of little faith, that it is because you have taken no bread </em>
that I say this<em class="Tillet">? </em>
(11) How is it that you do not perceive that I am not talking to you concerning <em class="HebMatt">
round loaves of </em>
bread? But beware of the <em class="HebMatt">
teaching</em>
 and<em class="HebMatt">
 behavior</em>
 of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&rdquo; (12) <em class="Tillet">
Then they heard and understood that he asked them not to beware the
leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees. </em>
(12.1) <em class="Oxyr">
Jesus explained, "The Pharisee plans in advance. Before doing wrong, he slyly reasons everything out</em>
<em class="Oxy-840">
 by making all manner of subtle excuse</em>. <em class="Oxyr">
Take care that you do not end up suffering the same fate as them. For
the wicked of humanity receive judgment not only among the living, but
also they will undergo punishment</em>
<em class="Oxy-840">
 and much torment </em>
<em class="Oxyr">
later.&rdquo;</em>
 (13) Now when Jesus came into <em class="HebMatt">
Caesarea</em>
 Philippi, he asked <em class="Tillet">
one and all of</em>
 his disciples, saying, &ldquo;What do the <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
sons of mankind</em>
 say <em class="HebMatt">
about me,</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
the Son of Man? </em>
(14) And they said, &ldquo;Some say you are John the Baptist; some,
Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.&rdquo; (15) He
said to them, &ldquo;But who do you say that I am?&rdquo; (16) And
Simon <em class="HebMatt">
called </em>
Peter answered and said, &ldquo;You are the <em class="HebMatt">
Messiah</em>, the Son of God <em class="HebMatt">
who has come into this world</em>.&rdquo; (17) And Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;<em class="Tillet">Happy</em>
 are you, Simon, <em class="GospHebrews">
Son of John </em>
<em class="Tillet">
for this was not revealed </em>
to you by<em class="Tillet">
 flesh and blood, but was revealed to you by my Father who is in heaven</em>. (18) And I also tell you, <em class="HebMatt">
you are a stone and over you</em>
 I will build my <em class="HebMatt">
house of prayer</em>
 and the <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
faction-makers</em>
 of <em class="HebMatt">
Hell</em>
 shall not <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
gain the upper hand</em>
 against <em class="HebMatt">
you</em>. (19) I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and
whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever
you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&rdquo; (20) Then he
charged the disciples that they should tell no man that he, <em class="Tillet">
Jesus</em>, was the <em class="HebMatt">
Messiah</em>. (21)  From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer <em class="HebMatt">
the injustice of </em>
many <em class="Tillet">
scourgings and many mockings</em>, from the elders, <em class="Tillet">
scribes</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
leading</em>
 priests, and be killed, and the third day he would be raised up. (22) And Peter took him <em class="HebMatt">
aside</em>, and began to rebuke him, saying, &ldquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">God forbid</em>, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Master</em>! <em class="Tillet">
All</em>
 this shall never happen to you.&rdquo; (23) But<em class="HebMatt">
 Jesus</em>
 turned, <em class="HebMatt">
looked at him</em>, and said to Peter, &ldquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">Follow after me!</em>
<em class="Tillet">

<em class="HebMatt">
Do not disobey me</em>

 but <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
only</em>
 in the <em class="HebMatt">
words of </em>
<em class="Tillet">
men</em>.&rdquo; (24) Then said Jesus to his disciples, &ldquo;If any man would follow me, he must <em class="Tillet">
reject</em>
 himself, and take up his cross, <em class="HebMatt">
and</em>
 be willing to <em class="HebMatt">
offer himself up to death</em>, and become a <em class="HebMatt">

<em class="HebMatt-nccg">

for my sake.</em>
 And whoever shall lose his life <em class="HebMatt">

 for my sake, <em class="Tillet">
the same will </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
save his soul for the life in the </em>

 <em class="HebMatt">
forever</em>
? <em class="HebMatt">
Or what good exchange does the man make if for the present things that are spoil</em>ing<em class="HebMatt">

  <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
They saw his body and the two men with him</em>. (4) <em class="HebMatt">
When they went away,</em>
Peter said to Jesus, &ldquo;It is good for us to be here. If you wish,
I will make here three tabernacles--one for you and one for Moses, and
one for Elijah,&rdquo; <em class="HebMatt">
because he did not know what he was saying</em>. (5) While he was still talking, a cloud overshadowed them, and <em class="HebMatt">
they were greatly alarmed</em>. And a voice out of the cloud said, &ldquo;This is my Son, <em class="HebMatt">
my beloved, </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
and</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 My delight is in him.</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Listen to him</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
You shall obey him.</em>&rdquo; (6) And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face<em class="Tillet">s</em>, and were very afraid.  (7) <em class="HebMatt">
When the voice ceased</em>, Jesus <em class="Tillet">
approached and touched them</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
said to them</em>, &ldquo;Arise, and be not afraid.&rdquo; (8) And lifting up their
eyes, they saw no one except Jesus only. (9) And as they were coming
down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, &ldquo;Do not
tell anyone about this vision <em class="Tillet">
which you have seen</em>
 until the Son of Man is risen from the dead.&rdquo; (10) And his disciples asked him, saying, &ldquo;Why do the <em class="HebMatt">
sages</em>
 say that Elijah must come first?&rdquo; (11) And he answered and said, &ldquo;Elijah indeed comes, and shall <em class="HebMatt">
save all the world</em>
 and restore all things (12.1) but I tell you that Elijah came already, and they did not know him, but did to him whatever they <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
desired</em>.&rdquo; (13)  Then the disciples understood that he spoke about John the Baptist. (12.2) Jesus then said, &ldquo;Even so shall <em class="HebMatt">
they do to </em>
the Son of Man.&rdquo; (14)  And when they approached the crowd, there came to him a <em class="Tillet">
certain</em>
 man who <em class="Tillet">
fell on his knees</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
bowing</em>, saying, (15) &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt-yaha">Master</em>, have <em class="Tillet">
compassion</em>
 on my son <em class="HebMatt">
because he is </em>
<em class="Tillet">
epileptic</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
and<em class="HebMatt">
 terrified of an evil spirit</em>. And <em class="Tillet">
he is sore afflicted with this sickness</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
He grinds his teeth and</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
he foams at the mouth.</em>
 And often <em class="HebMatt">
he falls from his place to the ground</em>, and he also falls into the fire, and often into the water. (16) And I
brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.&rdquo; (17)
And Jesus answered and said, &ldquo;O perverse generation! <em class="HebMatt">
Woe to you who deny </em>
<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
me!</em>
 How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear <em class="HebMatt">
your trouble</em>? Bring him here to me.&rdquo; (18) And Jesus rebuked him. And the
demon went out of him. And the boy was cured from that hour. (19) Then
came the disciples to Jesus <em class="HebMatt">
privately</em>, and said, &ldquo;Why could we not cast it out?&rdquo; (20) And he told them, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Because of the limitation of your</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
belief</em>. For truly I tell you, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
if within you becomes a </em>
<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
belief</em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 </em>
as a grain of mustard seed, you shall tell this mountain, &lsquo;<em class="Tillet">Move away from here</em>!&rsquo; and it shall <em class="Tillet">
immediately move</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
away</em>. And nothing shall be <em class="HebMatt">
withheld from you</em>. (21) But this kind <em class="HebMatt">
of demon</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
is overcome</em>
 only by prayer and fasting.&rdquo; (22) And while they <em class="Tillet">
were going into</em>
Galilee, Jesus told them, &ldquo;The Son of Man shall be delivered up
into the hands of men. (23) And they shall kill him. And on the third
day he shall be raised up.&rdquo; (24) And when they arrived at
Capernaum-<em class="HebMatt">
Martha</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
the tax-collectors</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
that received the </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
didrachma</em>
<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
came to Peter, and said, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Your teacher does not follow the custom to pay </em>
<em class="Tillet">
the </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
didrachma</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 tax</em>.&rdquo; (25) <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
And </em>
<em class="Tillet">
he</em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 said, </em>
&ldquo;<em class="HebMatt-nccg">Yes</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
certainly</em>
 he does.&rdquo; And when Peter came into the house, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
he preceded Jesus in order to speak to him</em>. And Jesus <em class="HebMatt">
anticipated him</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
prevented him from speaking first</em>, saying, &ldquo;What do you think, Simon? The kings of the earth, from whom do they receive <em class="Tillet">
customs</em>
 tribute? From their <em class="Tillet">
own</em>
 sons, or from <em class="HebMatt">
foreigners</em>?&rdquo; (26) And when he said, &ldquo;From <em class="HebMatt">
foreigners</em>,&rdquo;Jesus said to him, &ldquo;<em class="Tillet">If so</em>, the sons are free. <em class="HebMatt">
Do not be dismayed at this</em>.&rdquo; (27) <em class="HebMatt">
He said to Peter</em>, &ldquo;But, so we do not <em class="Tillet">
provoke them</em>, go to the sea, and cast <em class="Tillet">
a baited net</em>, and take up the fish that comes up first. And when you open his mouth, you shall find <em class="UnderlineBold">
a didrachma coin</em>. That take, and give it to them for <em class="HebMatt">
us</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter Eighteen</h2>

<p>(1) In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Who then <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
do you regard</em>
 is <em class="Tillet">
greatest</em>
 in the kingdom of the heavens?&rdquo; (2) And he called to himself a little <em class="Tillet">
boy</em>, and set him among them, (3) and said, &ldquo;Truly I tell you, except you <em class="Tillet">
repent</em>
 and turn, and become as <em class="HebMatt">
this</em>
 little child, you shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>. (4) <em class="Tillet">
Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this boy, the same shall be greatest in the kingdom of heaven</em>. (5) And whoso shall receive one such <em class="Tillet">
boy</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
as this</em>
 in my name receives me. (6) But whoever shall cause one of these little ones that believes on me to stumble, <em class="HebMatt">
it would be good</em>
 <em class="Agrapha">
for him never to have been born</em>. It would be better for him that an <em class="Tillet">
upper</em>
 millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be <em class="Tillet">
cast</em>
 into the depths of the sea <em class="Agrapha">
than that he should cause one of my chosen to miss the mark.</em>
 (7) Woe unto the <em class="HebMatt">
inhabitants of the</em>
 world because of <em class="Tillet">
offences</em>.  Such <em class="Tillet">
offences</em>
 must come. But woe to that man <em class="Tillet">
by whom an offence comes!</em>
 (8)  And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from yourself. It is <em class="HebMatt">
better</em>
 for you to enter into life maimed or <em class="Tillet">
lame</em>, rather than having two hands <em class="HebMatt">
and</em>
two feet to be cast into the eternal fire. (9) And if your eye causes
you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from yourself. It is <em class="HebMatt">
better</em>
 for you to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be <em class="HebMatt">
given </em>
over<em class="HebMatt">
 to</em>
 hell. (10) <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
And you are warned </em>
 not to <em class="HebMatt">
judge</em>
 one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels do <em class="Tillet">
continually</em>
 always <em class="HebMatt">
report on</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
the </em>
<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
children</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 of </em>
my Father who is in heaven.&rdquo; (11) And Jesus continued: &ldquo;The Son of Man <em class="HebMatt">
has devoted himself entirely to saving the enemies </em>
of God<em class="HebMatt">.</em>
 (12) What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them <em class="Tillet">
is lost</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
runs off</em>, doesn&rsquo;t he leave the ninety and nine <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
in the mountains</em>, and seek those which <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
were led</em>
 astray? (13)  And if <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
he happens to find it</em>, <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Amen</em>
 I tell you he rejoices over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray. (14) Even so, it is not the <em class="Tillet">
will</em>
 of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should <em class="HebMatt">
be lost</em>.&rdquo; (15) <em class="HebMatt">
At that time, Jesus said to Simon called Peter</em>, &ldquo;And if your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault <em class="HebMatt">
privately</em>. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. (16) But if he does not listen to you, <em class="HebMatt">
reprove him before another</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
If by every oath he does not listen, add still</em>
 one or two more witnesses, <em class="HebMatt">
in order that your words might be before</em>
 two <em class="HebMatt">
or three witnesses</em>
 because by two or three witnesses <em class="HebMatt">
a</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
matter</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
every word</em>
 may be established.  (17)  And if <em class="HebMatt">
by every oath</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
he does not listen, then</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
tell it in</em>
 the <em class="HebMatt">
assembly</em>. And if he also refuses to hear <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
in</em>
 the <em class="HebMatt">
assembly</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
consider him one to be shunned as an enemy and cruel</em>. (18) <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Amen</em>
 I tell you, what <em class="HebMatt">
oath</em>
 you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. And what <em class="HebMatt">
oath</em>
 you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. (19) Again I tell you that if two of you <em class="Tillet">
shall agree on earth,</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
everything which</em>
 you shall ask shall be done for you by my Father who is in heaven. (20) For where two or three are <em class="Tillet">
assembled</em>
 together in my Name, there am I among them. <em class="Agrapha">
Wherever there are two, they are not without God. And wherever there is one alone, I say I am with him</em>.&rdquo; (21)  Then came Peter also called<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 </em>
<em class="Tillet">
Kepha,</em>
 and he said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, how often shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me?&rdquo; (22) <em class="GospHebrews">
Jesus said to him, &ldquo;If your brother sins in word and has made
amends with you seven times in a day, receive him.&rdquo; Simon, his
disciple, said unto him, &ldquo;Seven times in a day?&rdquo; The Lord
answered and said to him &ldquo;up to seventy times seven. For the
prophets were found with sinful speech</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
even after they were anointed with the Holy Spirit. </em>
<em class="Oxyr-all-other">
The one who has not forgiven seventy times seven is not worthy of me</em>. (23) Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
king</em>
 who <em class="Tillet">
wished to</em>
 make an accounting with his servants. (24) And when he had begun to <em class="Tillet">
make the accounting</em>, one was brought to him that owed him <em class="HebMatt">
about</em>
 ten thousand <em class="HebMatt">
pieces of gold</em>. (25) <em class="HebMatt">
But he had nothing to give</em>
 to pay, so his <em class="HebMatt">
master</em>
 commanded him to be sold, and <em class="Tillet">
his wife and</em>
 children and all that he had, until<em class="Tillet">
 full payment was made to him</em>. (26) The servant therefore fell down <em class="HebMatt">
before his master</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
implored</em>
 him <em class="HebMatt">
to have pity on him</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
and to be patient with him because he would repay everything</em>
 saying, &lsquo;Lord, <em class="Tillet">
give me time, </em>
and be patient with me,<em class="Tillet">
 for I will pay you all</em>.&rsquo; (27) And the <em class="HebMatt">
master</em>
 of that servant <em class="HebMatt">
had pity on him</em>, released him, and forgave him the <em class="HebMatt">
entire</em>
 debt. (28) But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred <em class="Tillet">
meahs</em>
 [that is about 1% of what  the unforgiving servant was forgiven] and he laid hold on him, and <em class="Tillet">
held him fast</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
struck him</em>, saying, &lsquo;Pay what you owe.&rsquo; (29) So his fellow-servant fell down and begged him, saying, &lsquo;<em class="HebMatt">Trust me </em>
<em class="Tillet">
and give me time</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
and have patience with me, and I will pay <em class="HebMatt">
everything</em>
 to you.&rsquo; (30) And he would not <em class="HebMatt">
listen to him. So he</em>
 went and cast him into prison until he should pay <em class="Tillet">
all</em>
 that which was due him. (31) So when <em class="HebMatt">
the servants of the king</em>
 saw this, they were very <em class="HebMatt">
angry</em>, and came and told their <em class="HebMatt">
master</em>
 all that the servant had done. (32) Then his <em class="HebMatt">
master</em>
 called him, and said to him, &lsquo;You <em class="HebMatt">
cursed</em>
 Servant <em class="Tillet">
of Belial</em>, I forgave you all <em class="HebMatt">
your</em>
 debt because you <em class="Tillet">
entreated</em>
 me. (33) Shouldn&rsquo;t you also <em class="HebMatt">
have </em>
<em class="Tillet">
had pity on</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
and<em class="HebMatt">
 forgiven </em>
your servant even as I had <em class="Tillet">
pity on</em>
 you?&rsquo; (34) And his <em class="HebMatt">
master&rsquo;s</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
anger was kindled</em>, and<em class="HebMatt">
 commanded he be </em>
<em class="Tillet">
delivered to the prison</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
  </em>
and<em class="HebMatt">
 afflicted</em>
 until he should <em class="HebMatt">
re</em>pay <em class="HebMatt">
him</em>
 all <em class="Tillet">
his</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
debt</em>. (35) So shall also my Father <em class="Tillet">
in Heaven</em>
 do to you if you do not forgive your brother <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
in a perfect heart</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">your brother's</span> <em class="M&uuml;nster">
offenses against you</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter Nineteen</h2>

<p>(1) And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the region of <em class="HebMatt">
Judah</em>
 beyond the Jordan. (2) And great crowds followed him. And he healed <em class="HebMatt">
all of</em>
 them there. (3) And Pharisees came to him <em class="HebMatt">
to tempt</em>
 him, saying, &ldquo;Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for <em class="HebMatt">
any</em>
 cause <em class="HebMatt">
and to give her a bill of divorce</em>?&rdquo; (4) And he answered and said, &ldquo;Have you not read that the <em class="Coptic">
One</em>
 who made them <em class="HebMatt">
of old</em>, made them male and female?&rdquo; (5) And <em class="HebMatt">
he</em>
said, &ldquo;For this reason shall a man leave his father and mother,
and shall be joined to his wife. And the two shall become one
flesh.&rdquo; (6) So that they are no more two but one flesh. What
therefore <em class="HebMatt">
the Creator</em>
 has joined together, <em class="HebMatt">
man </em>
<em class="Tillet">
cannot</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
  separate</em>.&rdquo; (7) They asked him, &ldquo;Why then did Moses command to give her a bill of divorcement, and to put her away <em class="HebMatt">
from his house</em>?&rdquo; (8) He said to them, &ldquo;Moses for your <em class="HebMatt">
obstinacy</em>
 suffered you to put away your wives. But from <em class="Tillet">
the beginning</em>, it had not been so.  (9) And I tell you, whoever <em class="Tillet">
has put away or</em>
 shall put away his wife except for <em class="HebMatt">
adultery</em>, and shall marry another, commits adultery. And he that marries her
when she is put away in an unlawful manner commits adultery.&rdquo;
(10) The disciples said to him, &ldquo;If this is the situation between
a man and his wife, it is <em class="HebMatt">
not good to </em>
<em class="Tillet">
marry</em>.&rdquo; (11) He said to them, &ldquo;<em class="GospHebrews">
Not all can receive this saying</em>.<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
[It is]<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
only for<em class="HebMatt">
 those to whom it has been given</em>. (12) For there are eunuchs that were born as such <em class="Tillet">
from their mother&rsquo;s womb</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
These are those who have not sinned. </em>
And there are eunuchs that were made eunuchs by men. And there are eunuchs that made themselves eunuchs <em class="HebMatt">
who subdue their desire</em>
 for the kingdom of heaven&rsquo;s sake. <em class="HebMatt">
These are those who enter into great prominence</em>.  <em class="Tillet">
Whoso can accept </em>
it<em class="Tillet">, let him accept it.</em>
 And he that is able to <em class="HebMatt">
understand</em>
 it, let him <em class="HebMatt">
understand</em>
 it.&rdquo; (13) Then little children were brought to him that he should lay his hands on them, and pray <em class="HebMatt">
for them</em>. And <em class="HebMatt">
the disciples were driving them away</em>. (14) But Jesus said, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Permit</em>
 the little children, and <em class="HebMatt">
restrain them not</em>, to come to me. For the kingdom of the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s </em>
belongs to such who are like these children.  <em class="HebMatt">
Truly I say to you that one will not enter the kingdom of the heaven</em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 except he is like these</em>.&rdquo; (15) And <em class="HebMatt">
so</em>
 he laid his hands on them, and departed from there. (16) And two rich men approached him, and one came to him <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
showing reverence towards Him</em>, and <em class="GospHebrews">
the other of the two</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
said, &ldquo;<em class="GospHebrews">Teacher, what </em>
one<em class="GospHebrews">
 good thing shall I do and</em>
 thus<em class="GospHebrews">
 live</em>
<em class="Tillet">
 in the world to come</em>?&rdquo; (17) And he said to him: &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Why do you ask </em>
me<em class="HebMatt">
 about </em>
<em class="Tillet">
the</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 good? </em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
There is none good but God only.</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
But if you would <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
come</em>
 into life <em class="Tillet">
of the world to come</em>, <em class="GospHebrews">
perform the Law and the Prophets</em>.  And thus <em class="HebMatt">
keep the commandments</em>.&rdquo; (18) He said to him, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">What are they?</em>&rdquo; And Jesus said, &ldquo;You shall not kill, You shall not commit
adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness <em class="HebMatt">
against your neighbor</em>, (19) Honor your father and mother; and, You shall love your neighbor
as yourself.&rdquo; (20) The young man said to him, &ldquo;<em class="GospHebrews">All these things have I observed</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
from my youth</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
So yet what do I lack?&rdquo; </em>
(21) Jesus said to him, &ldquo;If you would be perfect, go, sell that
which you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in
heaven, and come, follow me.&rdquo; (22) But when the <em class="GospHebrews">
rich</em>
 man heard this teaching, <em class="GospHebrews">
he</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
scratched his head, and it displeased him.</em>
 And he went away <em class="HebMatt">
angry</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
for </em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
he</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
had<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
much property</em>. <em class="GospHebrews">
And the Lord said to him &ldquo;How do you say &lsquo;I have performed
the law and the prophets?&rsquo; seeing that it is written in the Law
&lsquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself,&rsquo; but many of
your brothers, sons of Abraham, are clad with filth, dying for hunger,
and your house is full of many goods, and nothing at all goes out of it
to them.&rdquo;</em>
 (23) And Jesus said to <em class="GospHebrews">
Simon, son of John</em>, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
who was sitting by Him</em>, &ldquo;Truly I tell you, It is hard for a rich man to <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
come</em>
 into the kingdom of the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>. (24) And again I tell you, it is easier for <em class="AramaicGosp">
camel-rope </em>
to go through the eye of a needle, <em class="Tillet">
than to bring the rich</em>
 into the kingdom of the <em class="GospHebrews">
heavens</em>.&rdquo; Jesus then prayed: &ldquo;<em class="GospHebrews">One in the heavens, grant salvation</em>.&rdquo; (25) And when the disciples heard it, they were very
astonished, saying, &ldquo;Who then can be saved?&rdquo; (26) And Jesus
looking upon them said, &ldquo;With men <em class="HebMatt">
the matter is difficult</em>; but with God all things are <em class="HebMatt">
easy</em>.&rdquo; (27) Then Peter answered and said to him, &ldquo;We have left
all, and followed you. What then shall we have?&rdquo; (28) And Jesus
said to them, &ldquo;Truly I tell you that you who have followed me, in
the <em class="HebMatt">
day of judgment</em>
 when the Son of <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Man</em>
 shall sit on <em class="Tillet">
his</em>
 throne of his glory, you also shall sit upon <em class="HebMatt">
the</em>
 twelve thrones <em class="Tillet">
and</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
judge</em>
 the twelve tribes of Israel. (29) And everyone that has left <em class="HebMatt">
his</em>
 home (<em class="HebMatt">including his wife and his</em>
 children, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother), <em class="Tillet">
or </em>
left his<em class="Tillet">
 lands, </em>
for my name&rsquo;s sake, shall receive a hundred <em class="HebMatt">
like them</em>
 and shall inherit <em class="HebMatt">
the kingdom of heaven </em>
and <em class="Tillet">
the sublime life</em>. (30) <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Many of the first ones shall be last</em>. <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
And many of the last ones shall be first.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty</h2>

<p>(1) <em class="HebMatt">
After this, Jesus said to his disciples</em>, &ldquo;For the kingdom of heaven is like a man that was <em class="HebMatt">
a master in his house</em>
 who <em class="HebMatt">
rose</em>
 and went out early in the morning to hire laborers to work in his vineyard. (2) And when he had agreed with the laborers for <em class="HebMatt">
one </em>
denarius <em class="HebMatt">
for the </em>
<em class="Tillet">
whole</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 day</em>, he sent them into his vineyard. (3)
And he went out about nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and saw others
standing idle in the marketplace. (4) And he said to them, &lsquo;Go
also into the vineyard, and whatever is <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
just</em>
 I will give you.&rsquo; And they went their way. (5) Again he went out about <em class="HebMatt">
noon </em>
and <em class="HebMatt">
also </em>
at three o&rsquo;clock, and did likewise. (6) And about five
o&rsquo;clock, he went out and found others standing around. And he
said to them, &lsquo;Why are you standing here idle all day?&rsquo; (7)
They said to him, &lsquo;Because no man has hired us.&rsquo; He said to
them, &lsquo;Go also into the vineyard.&rsquo; (8) And when even<em class="HebMatt">
ing</em>
 had come, the <em class="HebMatt">
master</em>
 of the vineyard said to his <em class="Tillet">
overseer</em>, &lsquo;Call the laborers, and pay them their wages.&rsquo; <em class="HebMatt">
He began with the last and finished with the first</em>. (9) <em class="HebMatt">
The last received one </em>
denarius. <em class="Tillet">
And when those came that were hired about </em>
three o&rsquo;clock<em class="Tillet">, they received each man </em>
a denarius. (10) And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more <em class="Tillet">
than these</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
But he only gave a </em>
denarius<em class="HebMatt">
 to each of them</em>. (11)  And when they received it, they murmured against the <em class="HebMatt">
master of the vineyard</em>, (12)  saying, &lsquo;These last have spent but one hour, and you have made them <em class="Tillet">
on </em>
the same<em class="Tillet">
 level with us</em>
 who have borne the burden of the day and the heat.&rsquo; (13) But he answered and said to one of them, &lsquo;<em class="HebMatt">My</em>
 Friend, I do you no <em class="HebMatt">
injustice</em><em class="Tillet">.</em>
 Didn&rsquo;t you <em class="Tillet">
contract</em>
 with me for <em class="HebMatt">
one </em>
denarius? (14) Take <em class="HebMatt">
it</em>
 and go. <em class="HebMatt">
If I wish</em>
 to give to this last, even as to you,<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
(15) <em class="HebMatt">
may I not do according to my desire?</em>
  Or is <em class="HebMatt">
there evil in your eyes</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
when</em>
 I am good?&rsquo; (16) So the last shall be first, and the first last. <em class="HebMatt">
Many are called but few are the chosen</em>.&rdquo; (17) And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
in secret</em>, and on the way he said to them, (18) &ldquo;We are going to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief <em class="HebMatt">
sages</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
and</em>
 priests. And they shall condemn him to death. (19) And they shall deliver him to the Gentiles to <em class="HebMatt">
smite and destroy him</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
but on</em>
 the third day he shall be raised up.&rdquo; (20) Then the mother of the sons of <em class="Tillet">
Zabdi</em>
 with her sons came to him, <em class="HebMatt">
bowing down </em>
<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
before</em> him to ask him something. (21)
And he said to her, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; She said to him,
&ldquo;Command that these--my two sons--may sit, one on your right
hand, and one on your left hand, in your kingdom.&rdquo; (22) But Jesus
answered and said, &ldquo;You do not know what you are asking.&rdquo;
Turning to the sons, Jesus asked, &ldquo;Are you able <em class="HebMatt">
to endure the suffering and death that I am about to endure?</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
Can you drink the cup that I shall drink of, and be immersed in the immersion that I shall be immersed in?</em>&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;We <em class="Tillet">
can</em>.&rdquo;  (23)  He said to them, <em class="Tillet">
&ldquo;Indeed you shall drink of my cup, and shall be immersed in the immersion that I shall be immersed in</em>. But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give <em class="HebMatt">
to you</em>, but it belongs only<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="Tillet">
for whom it is prepared </em>
for by<em class="Tillet">
 my Father</em>.&rdquo; (24) And when the ten heard it, they were moved <em class="HebMatt">
with anger in their eyes</em>
concerning the two brethren. (25) But Jesus called them to himself, and
said, &ldquo;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles <em class="Tillet">
rule</em>
 it over them, and their great ones <em class="HebMatt">
seek to subdue them</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
exercise authority among them</em>. (26) <em class="HebMatt">
It will not be so among you</em>. But whoever <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
wants to</em>
 become great among you shall <em class="HebMatt">
serve you</em>. (27) And whoever <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
wants to</em>
 be first among you shall be your servant, (28) even as the Son of Man came not to be <em class="HebMatt">
served</em>, but to <em class="HebMatt">
serve</em>, and to give <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
his soul </em>
as a ransom for many.&rdquo; (28.1) And Jesus later told his disciples,  &ldquo;<em class="GospHebrews">Seek to grow to be less, and you will grow to be more, while  great ones who make no such effort will be brought low</em>. <em class="Codex-D">
And when</em>
 <em class="Codex-D">
you go in and have been called upon to dine, do not recline in the most
prominent places, lest one more honorable than you should come and the
one who called the dinner should come to you and say: &lsquo;Your spot
is still lower,&rsquo; and you should be ashamed. But if you sit down
at the lesser place and one lesser than you should come, the one who
called the dinner will say to you: &lsquo;Go still higher.&rsquo; And
this will be more profitable for you</em>.  <em class="GreekVariants">
Thus, seek to increase from that which is small, and from the greater to become less.&rdquo; </em>
(29) And as they went <em class="HebMatt">
into</em>
 Jericho, a great crowd followed him. (30) And two blind men <em class="Tillet">
went out and sat</em>
 by the way side. When they heard that the <em class="HebMatt">
prophet</em>
 Jesus <em class="HebMatt">
from </em>
<em class="GreekVariants">
Nazara</em>
 was passing by, they cried out, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt-nccg">Master</em>, have mercy on us, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Master!</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
Oh</em>
 Son of David!&rdquo;  (31) And the crowd rebuked them, <em class="HebMatt">
saying: &lsquo;Be silent!&rsquo;</em>
 that they should hold their peace. But they cried out the more, saying, &ldquo;Have mercy on us, <em class="HebMatt">
Lord</em>, <em class="Tillet">
Oh</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
son of David!</em>&rdquo;  (32) And Jesus <em class="HebMatt">
stopped</em>, and called them, and said, &ldquo;What do you want me to do for you?&rdquo;  (33) They said to him, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt-nccg">Master</em>, that our eyes may be <em class="Tillet">
restored to sight</em>.&rdquo; (34) And Jesus,<em class="HebMatt">
 having pity on them</em>, touched their eyes. <em class="HebMatt">
And he said to them, &ldquo;Your </em>
<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
belief</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 has healed you</em>.&rdquo; And immediately they received their sight, <em class="HebMatt">
praised God</em>, and followed him. <em class="HebMatt">
Then, all the people praised God because of this</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-One</h2>

<p>(1) And when they came near to Jerusalem, and arrived at Bethphage <em class="HebMatt">
on</em>
 the mount of Olives, Jesus then sent two disciples,  (2) telling them, &ldquo;Go into the <em class="HebMatt">
fortress</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
enclosure</em>
 that is opposite from you, and immediately you shall find a female donkey  tied, and a <em class="Tillet">
foal</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
by her side</em>. Loose them, and bring them to me. (3) And if anyone says anything to you, say to them, &ldquo;The<em class="HebMatt">
 Master</em>
 needs them. And he will quickly <em class="HebMatt">
let them go</em>.&rdquo;
(4) Now this came to pass to fulfill what the prophet had said, saying,
(5) &ldquo;Tell the daughter of Zion, Your King comes to you. <em class="Tillet">
Poor</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
humble,</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
just and victorious is he</em>, riding upon a female donkey, <em class="Tillet">
even</em>
 upon a colt, the foal of a female donkey<em class="UnderlineBold">.</em>&rdquo; (6) And the disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do. (7) And they brought the female donkey and the<em class="Tillet">
 foal</em>, and put on them their garments. <em class="Tillet">
And they put him </em>
on the foal.<em class="HebMatt">
 Then they made the ascent.</em>
 (8) <em class="HebMatt">
Many</em>
 in the crowd spread their garments in the way. And others cut <em class="Tillet">
down leafy</em>
 branches from the trees, and spread them in the way<em class="HebMatt">
 before him and behind him</em>, <em class="Tillet">
carpeting the way</em>. (9) And the crowds cried, saying, &ldquo;Save us on high!&rdquo;  &ldquo;<em class="GospHebrews">
Save us</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
on high</em>. <em class="Tillet">
To the </em>

and<em class="Tillet">
 Son of David</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
Please save us! Savior of the poor! </em>
Blessed is he that comes in the name of <em class="HebMatt">
Yahweh the Lord </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Adonai</em>. <em class="GospHebrews">
Save us</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
our savior! Please save the weary! May you be glorified in heaven and in earth</em>.&rdquo; (10) And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city <em class="Tillet">
was seething </em>
with interest and<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
quaked</em>
 saying, &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; (11)  And the crowds said, &ldquo;This is Jesus, <em class="HebMatt">
the Prophet</em>
 from <em class="GreekVariants">
Nazara</em>.&rdquo; (12) And Jesus entered into the <em class="HebMatt">
house</em>
 of <em class="HebMatt">
Yahweh</em>, and <em class="HebMatt">
found there</em>
 them that sold and bought in the Temple. And he overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the <em class="Tillet">
stalls</em>
 of them that <em class="HebMatt">
were selling</em>
 doves. (12.1) <em class="GospHebrews">
For a certain fiery and starry light shone from His eyes which terrified them and put them to flight. </em>
(13) And he said to them, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;My house shall be called a house of prayer <em class="HebMatt">
by all the nations</em>, but you make it <em class="Tillet">
a robber&rsquo;s den</em>
--<em class="HebMatt">
a cave of violent men</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo; (14) And the blind and the lame came to him in the Temple. And he healed them. (15) The chief <em class="HebMatt">
sages and</em>
 priests  <em class="HebMatt">
came to see</em>
 the wonder<em class="HebMatt">s</em>
 that he did, and the children that were crying in the Temple and saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Let the</em>
 Son of <em class="HebMatt">
God</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
be praised</em>. <em class="Tillet">
Hoshanna to the </em>
<em class="Coptic">
house</em>
<em class="Tillet">
 of David.</em>
&rdquo;<em class="HebMatt">The sages</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
mocked </em>
and <em class="Tillet">
were displeased</em>
 (16)  and said to him, &ldquo;Do you hear what they are saying?&rdquo; And Jesus replied to them,<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
&ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">I heard them</em>. Did you never read, &lsquo;Out of the mouth of <em class="HebMatt">
children </em>
you have <em class="HebMatt">
established strength</em>
?&rsquo;&rdquo; (17) And he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there. <em class="HebMatt">
There he was explaining the kingdom of God</em>. (18) Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he was hungry. (19) And seeing a fig tree by the way side, he <em class="HebMatt">
drew near</em>
to it, and found nothing on it, but leaves only. And he said to it,
&ldquo;Let there be no fruit from you from now and forever.&rdquo; And
immediately the fig tree <em class="HebMatt">
dried up</em>. (20) And when the disciples saw it, they were amazed, saying, &ldquo;How did the fig tree immediately <em class="HebMatt">
dry up</em>?&rdquo; (21) And Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Truly I tell you, if you have faith <em class="HebMatt">
without doubt</em>, you shall be able to do not only what was done to the fig tree, but
even if you should say to this mountain, &lsquo;Be taken up and cast
into the sea,&rsquo; it shall be done. (22) And all things, whatever
you ask in prayer <em class="Tillet">
and faith</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
while</em>
 believing, you shall receive.&rdquo; (23) And he <em class="HebMatt">
came</em>
 into the Temple <em class="HebMatt">
to teach</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
and there came to him</em>
 the <em class="HebMatt">
sages</em>, chief priests and the <em class="HebMatt">
rulers</em>
 of the people, and said, &ldquo;By what <em class="HebMatt">
power</em>
 do you do these things? And who gave you this <em class="HebMatt">
strength</em>?&rdquo; (24) And Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;I also will
ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by
what <em class="HebMatt">
power</em>
 I do these things. (25) The baptism of John, from where did it come from? From heaven or from men?&rdquo; And <em class="HebMatt">
they argued among themselves</em>, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">What shall we say?</em>
If we shall say, &lsquo;From heaven,&rsquo; he will say to us,
&lsquo;Why then did you not believe him?&rsquo; (26) But if we shall
say, &lsquo;From men,&rsquo; we have to fear the crowd for all <em class="HebMatt">
of them believe</em>
 John <em class="HebMatt">
w</em>as a prophet.&rdquo; (27) And they answered Jesus, and said, &ldquo;We
do not know.&rdquo; He also said to them, &ldquo;Neither then do I tell
you by what <em class="HebMatt">
power</em>
 I do these things.&rdquo; (28)  <em class="HebMatt">
In that evening, Jesus said to his critics</em>, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">What is your opinion</em>? A man had two sons. And he came to the first, and said, &lsquo;Son, go work to-day in <em class="HebMatt">
my</em>
 vineyard.&rsquo; (29) And the son answered and said, <em class="HebMatt">
&lsquo;I do not wish to</em>,&rsquo; but afterward he <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
was sorry</em>, and went. (30) And the father came to the	 second son, and said likewise. And the second son answered and said, <em class="HebMatt">
&lsquo;Here I am Sir</em>.&rsquo; But he did not go.  (31)  Which of the two did the will of <em class="HebMatt">
the</em>
 father?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;The first.&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly, I tell you that <em class="Tillet">
transgressors</em>
-- the <em class="HebMatt">
tax-collectors, violent men</em>, publicans and the harlots --<em class="HebMatt">
will </em>
be advanced over<em class="HebMatt">
 you</em>
 into the kingdom of <em class="HebMatt">
heaven</em>. (32) For John came to you in the Way of righteousness, and you did not  <em class="UnderlineBold">
seriously listen to him</em>.   But <em class="HebMatt">
tax-collectors, violent men</em>, and the harlots -- <em class="Tillet">
transgressors</em>
--<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
<em class="UnderlineBold">
did heed him seriously</em>. But you, when you saw it, <em class="HebMatt">
you did not believe him, </em>
and you<em class="HebMatt">
 did not turn in repentance</em>
 afterwards<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
as they have done. <em class="HebMatt">
To him who has ears to hear let him hear and be ashamed.</em>&rdquo; (33) <em class="HebMatt">
At that time, Jesus said to his disciples and a company of the Jews</em>, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Hear now </em>
<em class="Tillet">
another parable</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
-- the parable of the Sower</em>. There was a <em class="HebMatt">
certain honorable man</em>
 who planted a vineyard, and <em class="HebMatt">
walled it up on every side</em>, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower <em class="HebMatt">
in its midst</em>, and <em class="HebMatt">
entrusted it to </em>
<em class="Tillet">
vinedressers</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="Tillet">
to cultivate it</em>, and then he went into another country. (34) And when the fruit season approached, he sent servants to <em class="Tillet">
the vinedressers</em>
--<em class="HebMatt">
those working </em>
the vineyard -- to receive his <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
profit</em>. (35) <em class="HebMatt">
But the </em>
<em class="Tillet">
vinedressers</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. (36) Again, he sent <em class="HebMatt">
many more</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
servants</em>
 than the first time. And they did the same to them. (37) <em class="HebMatt">
Finally</em>, he sent to them his son, saying, &lsquo;<em class="HebMatt">Perhaps</em>
 they will <em class="HebMatt">
honor</em>
 my son.&rsquo; (38) But the <em class="Tillet">
vinedressers</em>
 when they saw the son, said among themselves, &lsquo;This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and <em class="HebMatt">
we will inherit his estate</em>.&rsquo; (39)  And they took him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. (40) <em class="Tillet">
Think for yourselves</em>
--when the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to <em class="HebMatt">
them</em>? <em class="Tillet">
These vinedressers</em>?&rdquo; (41) They said to Jesus, <em class="HebMatt">
&ldquo;As for the wicked </em>
<em class="Tillet">
vinedressers</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
--</em>
<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
the ungodly --</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
he will destroy them in </em>
<em class="Tillet">
their wickedness</em>, and will let out the vineyard to other <em class="HebMatt">
workers</em>
 who shall <em class="HebMatt">
immediately</em>
 render him the <em class="HebMatt">
portion of his</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
profit</em>.&rdquo; (42) Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Did you never read in the <em class="Tillet">
Psalms</em>, &lsquo;The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner. This was from <em class="HebMatt">
Yahweh</em>, And it is marvelous in our eyes?&rsquo; (43) Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of <em class="HebMatt">
heaven</em>
 shall be taken away from you and shall be given to a nation <em class="HebMatt">
producing fruit</em>. (44) And he that falls on this stone shall be <em class="HebMatt">
cast down</em>
 and<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
 broken apart</em>
.&rdquo; (45) And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his
parables, they perceived that he spoke about them. (46) And they sought
<em class="HebMatt">
to kill him</em>
 but they feared the crowds <em class="HebMatt">
who believed him to be a prophet</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Two</h2>

<p>(1) And Jesus answered and spoke again in
parables to them, saying, (2) &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like a
certain king who made a marriage <em class="HebMatt">
ceremony</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
for his son</em>. (3) And he sent out his servants to call them that were <em class="HebMatt">
invited</em>
 to the marriage <em class="HebMatt">
ceremony</em>. And they <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
did not want to come</em>. (4) Again he sent out other servants, saying, &lsquo;Tell them that are invited. I have made ready my dinner. My oxen and <em class="Tillet">
my geese</em>
 are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage <em class="HebMatt">
ceremony</em>.&rsquo; (5) But they <em class="HebMatt">
scorned it</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
were unresponsive</em>,<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
and went their way, <em class="HebMatt">
some into the city</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
some to their businesses</em>. (6) And <em class="HebMatt">
others</em>
 grabbed his servants, and <em class="HebMatt">
abused</em>
 them, and killed them.  (7)  <em class="HebMatt">
The king heard this, and</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
his anger was kindled</em>. And he sent <em class="Tillet">
his hosts</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
and destroyed those murderers, </em>
and burned their <em class="HebMatt">
houses</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
with fire</em>. (8) Then he said to his servants, &lsquo;The wedding is ready, but
they that were invited were not worthy. (9) Go therefore to the <em class="Tillet">
outgoings</em>
 of the highways, and as many as you shall find, invite to the marriage <em class="HebMatt">
ceremony</em>.&rsquo; (10) And those servants went out into the highways, and
gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. And the
wedding <em class="HebMatt">
ceremony</em>
 was filled with <em class="HebMatt">
those who were eating</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
at </em>
the<em class="Tillet">
 table</em>. (11) But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man
who did not have on a wedding-garment. (12) And he said to him, &lsquo;<em class="HebMatt">My</em>
 Friend, how did you come in here not having a wedding-garment?&rsquo; And he was <em class="HebMatt">
silent</em>. (13) Then the king said to the servants, &lsquo;Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the <em class="HebMatt">
nether most and lowest hell</em>. There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. (14) <em class="HebMatt">
Many are called but few are chosen</em>.&rdquo; (15) Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might ensnare him in <em class="HebMatt">
what he said</em>. (16) And they sent to him their disciples, with <em class="HebMatt">
violent men</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
from Herod</em>, saying, &ldquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">Master</em>, we know that you are <em class="Tillet">
sincere</em>, and <em class="HebMatt">
faithfully</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
study </em>
the way of God in truth. <em class="HebMatt">
You fear nothing</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
and do not argue from appearances, </em>
and remain<em class="HebMatt">
 impartial</em>
--<em class="Tillet">
not influenced by any man</em>. (17) Tell us therefore, what you think. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?&rdquo; (18) But Jesus <em class="HebMatt">
recognized</em>
 their <em class="HebMatt">
deceit</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
maliciousness</em>, and said, &ldquo;Why <em class="HebMatt">
entice</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
tempt</em>
 me, you hypocrites? (19) Show me the <em class="HebMatt">
tax coin</em>
 to pay <em class="M&uuml;nster">
tribute</em>.&rdquo; And they brought to him a <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
common one</em>
-- a <em class="M&uuml;nster">
denarius</em>. (20) And he said to them, &ldquo;Whose <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
likeness</em>
 is this <em class="M&uuml;nster">
image</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
inscription</em>
?&rdquo; (21) They said to him, &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Then he said to them, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Return</em>
therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s, and to God the
things that are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo; (22) And when they heard it, they
were amazed, and left him, and went away. (23) On that day there came
to him Sadducees, <em class="HebMatt">
and those</em>
 that say that <em class="Tillet">
there shall not be a resurrection </em>
<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
of the dead</em>. And they asked him,  (24)  saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Rabbi</em>, Moses said, &lsquo;If a man die, having no children, his brother
shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.&rsquo; (25)
Now there were <em class="HebMatt">
among us</em>
seven brethren. And the first married and deceased, and having no seed
left his wife unto his brother. (26) In like manner the second also,
and the third, unto the seventh. (27) And after them all, the woman
died. (28) <em class="HebMatt">
Since she belonged to all of them,</em>
 whose wife shall she be of the seven <em class="Tillet">
in the resurrection</em>? <em class="Tillet">
Because all seven were her husbands. </em>
(29) But Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;You err, not <em class="HebMatt">
understanding</em>
 the <em class="HebMatt">
Writings</em>, nor the power of God. (30) For in <em class="HebMatt">
the day of</em>
 the resurrection, <em class="HebMatt">
men will not take women</em>
 nor <em class="HebMatt">
women will take men</em>, but are as angels <em class="HebMatt">
of God</em>
in heaven. (31) But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have you
not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, (32) &lsquo;I am
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?&rsquo; <em class="HebMatt">
If so</em>, God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.&rdquo; (33) And when the crowds heard it, they were astonished at his<em class="HebMatt">
 wisdom</em>. (34) But the Pharisees <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
saw that the Sadducees had no answer</em>, so <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
they came together</em>
 and<em class="HebMatt">
 joined his scorners</em>. (35)  And one of them, a <em class="HebMatt">
sage</em>
-- a <em class="Tillet">
doctor of the Law</em>
-- asked him a question <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
to tempt</em>
 him:  (36) &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Rabbi</em>, which is the great<em class="HebMatt">est</em>
 commandment in the Law?&rdquo;  (37) And he said to him, &ldquo;<em class="GospHebrews">This is the First Commandment: You shall </em>

love and </em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
worship </em>

shall you serve with all your heart and with all your strength</em>, and with all your  mind. (38) <em class="Tillet">
This is the</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
greatest commandment in the whole Law</em>. <em class="Tillet">
And </em>
this is the first. (39) <em class="Tillet">
But the</em>
 second <em class="Tillet">
is</em>
 like it, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rsquo;&nbsp;(40) On these two commandments <em class="Tillet">
hangs all the Law and the prophets</em>. (40.1) <em class="Didach">
There are two ways--one of life and one of death. and there is a great difference between the two ways. </em>
(40.2) <em class="Didach">
The way of life is this. </em>
(40.3) <em class="Didach">
First of all, you shall love the God that made you</em>. (40.4) <em class="Didach">
Secondly, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.</em>
 (40.5) <em class="Didach">
And all things you would not want to happen to yourself, neither do to another. </em>
(40.6). <em class="Didach">
These words are the Teaching of the Way of life.&rdquo;</em>
 (41) Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, (42) saying, &ldquo;What do you think of the <em class="HebMatt">
Messiah</em>? Whose son is he?&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;The son of David.&rdquo; (43) He said to them, &ldquo;How then does David <em class="HebMatt">
by </em>
the <em class="HebMatt">
holy</em>
 spirit call him <em class="HebMatt">
Master</em>, saying, (44) <em class="HebMatt">
&lsquo;Yahweh&nbsp;</em>said to <em class="HebMatt">
my Master</em>
 &ldquo;Sit on my right hand until I <em class="HebMatt">
make</em>
  your enemies <em class="HebMatt">
the footstool of your feet</em>?&rdquo; (45) If David then calls him <em class="HebMatt">
Master</em>, how is he his son?&rdquo; (46) And no one was able to answer him a word, <em class="HebMatt">
and</em>
 from that day <em class="HebMatt">
they feared to</em>
 ask him any more questions.</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Three</h2>

<p>(1) Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to
his disciples, (2) saying, &ldquo;The scribes and the Pharisees sit on
Moses&rsquo; seat. (3) <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
Now all that</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
he,</em>
 Moses, <em class="HebMatt">
says to you keep and do</em>
 but do not <em class="HebMatt">
do</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
works according to</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
their </em>
<em class="HebMatt-yaha">
commandments</em>
 for they <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
quote </em>
Moses but do not <em class="M&uuml;nster">
do</em>
 what they quote. (4) Yes, <em class="HebMatt">
they demand</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
set forth</em>
 heavy burdens<em class="HebMatt">
 that the shoulders of men are not able to bear</em>, <em class="Tillet">
and they  </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
themselves will not lift a finger</em>
 to help<em class="HebMatt">
 move them. </em>
(5) But all their <em class="HebMatt">
actions</em>
  and <em class="Tillet">
works</em>
 they do for <em class="HebMatt">
appearances</em>
--<em class="Tillet">
to be seen by the children of men.</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
They wear expensive garments</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
and large tassels,</em>
 (6) and love <em class="Tillet">
the principal couches and seats at dinner</em>, and <em class="HebMatt">
to be seated first</em>
 in the synagogues <em class="Tillet">
and </em>
at<em class="Tillet">
 benedictions</em>
 (7) and to be called Rabbi <em class="Tillet">
in the marketplaces</em>. (8) <em class="HebMatt">
As to you, do not desire to be</em>
 called Rabbi, neither<em class="Tillet">
 be called Rabbi. </em>
For one is your <em class="HebMatt">
Rabbi,</em>
 your teacher,<em class="Tillet">
 the Messiah</em>, and you are all brothers. (9) <em class="Tillet">
Also do not be called father upon the earth</em>.  And<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 don&rsquo;t you call</em>
 any man on the earth your father because one is your Father--He who is in heaven. (10) Neither be called <em class="Tillet">
teachers</em>
 for one is your <em class="Tillet">
teacher</em>
 even the <em class="HebMatt">
Messiah</em>. (11) <em class="HebMatt">
The</em>
 greatest among you shall <em class="HebMatt">
serve you</em>. (12) And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled. And whoever shall humble himself shall be exalted. (13) But woe to you <em class="HebMatt">
sages</em>, <em class="Thomas">
scribes</em>
 and Pharisees! Hypocrites! Because you have <em class="Thomas">
received the keys of knowledge of the kingdom and have hidden them. </em>
And you thus shut the kingdom of heaven against  <em class="Tillet">
the children of</em>
 men while<em class="Muslim">
 you yourselves have not entered the kingdom</em>. And <em class="Oxyr">
to them that were entering you did not open</em>
 or<em class="HebMatt">

 them to enter, even those <em class="HebMatt">
who </em>
<em class="Tillet">
eager</em>ly<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
wished</em>
 to enter. (14) Woe to you <em class="HebMatt">
sages,</em>
 and Pharisees! Hypocrites! For you <em class="HebMatt">
divide and </em>
devour widows&rsquo; houses <em class="HebMatt">
with  lengthy exposition</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
long speeches</em>. Therefore you shall receive <em class="Tillet">
a lengthy </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
punishment</em>. (15) <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees! Hypocrites!</em>
 For you travel <em class="M&uuml;nster">
a circuit of</em>
 sea and land to <em class="HebMatt">
bind the heart of one man</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
in your faith</em>
 <em class="Muslim">
as a disciple</em>. And when <em class="Muslim">
you find one</em>, <em class="Muslim">
you teach him your ways</em>
 <em class="Muslim">
so he becomes</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
doubly worse</em>
 <em class="Muslim">
than you</em>, and thus<em class="Tillet">
 twice more a son of hell than yourselves</em>. <em class="Muslim">
You have not let other people enter the kingdom of heaven since you yourself have not entered it</em>. (16)  Woe to you, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
seat of the</em>
 blind <em class="M&uuml;nster">
guides</em>, that say, &lsquo;Whoever shall swear by the temple, <em class="HebMatt">
he is not obligated</em>

it is nothing</em>, but whoever shall swear by <em class="HebMatt">
anything which is consecrated to </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
the structure</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 of the temple</em>
 such as the <em class="Tillet">
gold of the temple, </em>
you say he is <em class="HebMatt">
obligated to pay</em>.  (17)  You <em class="HebMatt">
mad</em>
 and blind! For which is greater? <em class="Tillet">
The gold? Or the Temple that sanctifies the gold?</em>
 (18) And you say, &lsquo;Whoever shall swear by the altar, <em class="HebMatt">
is not obligated</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
it is nothing</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
but whosoever shall </em>

gift<em class="HebMatt">

then </em>
you say<em class="HebMatt">
 he is obligated to give it</em>.&rsquo; (19) You blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar <em class="Tillet">
that sanctifies the gift</em>? (20) He therefore that swears by the altar, swears by it, and by all things upon it.  (21)...(22) And he that swears by <em class="HebMatt">
the throne of God</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
swears by it</em>
 and by Him that <em class="HebMatt-nccg">

pay tithes of</em>
 mint, <em class="HebMatt">
dill</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
pomegranate</em>

 matters <em class="Tillet">
in the Law</em>
--<em class="HebMatt">
the Torah&rsquo;s judgments </em>
on <em class="Luke">

 </em>
<em class="Tillet">
loving-</em><em class="HebMatt">kindness, faithfulness, </em>
and<em class="HebMatt">
 truth</em>.<em class="HebMatt">
 These are commands worthy of doing. One should not forget them</em>. (24) <em class="HebMatt">
Offspring of</em>
 blind <em class="HebMatt">
leaders</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
nit-pickers</em>
who strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel! (25) Woe to you,
scribes and Pharisees! Hypocrites! For you wash the outside of the cup<em class="GospHebrews">s</em>
 and of the platter<em class="GospHebrews">s</em>, but <em class="HebMatt">
inside of them is</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
full of wickedness, </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
robbery</em>
 and<em class="HebMatt">
 uncleanness</em>. (26) <em class="HebMatt">
Hypocrite!</em>
 Wash first the inside of the cup <em class="HebMatt">
in order that the outside might become pure</em>. (27) Woe to you <em class="HebMatt">
sages</em>
 and Pharisees! Hypocrites! For you are like white-washed sepulchres which outwardly appear beautiful to <em class="Tillet">
the children of men</em>, but inwardly are full of <em class="HebMatt">
the</em>
 bones <em class="HebMatt">
of the dead</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
the filthy</em>. (28) <em class="Tillet">
So</em>
 you also outwardly appear righteous to the <em class="Tillet">
children of</em>
 men, but inwardly you are full of <em class="Tillet">
depravity</em>, hypocrisy and <em class="Tillet">
violence</em>. (29) Woe to you <em class="HebMatt">
sages</em>
and Pharisees! Hypocrites! For you build the sepulchres of the
prophets, and garnish the tombs of the righteous, (30) and say,
&lsquo;If we had been alive in the days of our fathers, we should not
have <em class="HebMatt">
permitted them to put to death</em>
 the prophets.&rsquo; (31) Wherefore you <em class="HebMatt">
bear</em>
 witness <em class="HebMatt">
against</em>
 yourselves that you are sons of them that slew the prophets. (32) <em class="HebMatt">
You behave according to the deeds of </em>
your fathers. (33) You serpents! You offspring of vipers! How shall you escape the judgment of hell <em class="HebMatt">
if you do not turn in repentance</em>?&rdquo; (34) <em class="HebMatt">
At that time, Jesus said to the crowd</em>, &ldquo;Therefore, I send to you prophets, and <em class="HebMatt">
sages</em>, and scribes. Some of them you shall kill. And some of them you shall <em class="HebMatt">
afflict</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
with whips</em>
 in your synagogues. And <em class="UnderlineBold">
some you will</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 pursue </em>
from city to city. (35) <em class="UnderlineBold">
This is so</em>
that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from
the blood of Abel the righteous unto the blood of Zachariah son of <em class="GospHebrews">
Jehoiada</em>
 whom you slew between the sanctuary and the altar. (36)  Truly I tell you, all these things shall come upon this generation <em class="HebMatt">
and upon</em>
 (37) Jerusalem, <em class="HebMatt">
who</em>
 kills the prophets, and <em class="HebMatt">
removes those</em>
that are sent to her! How often I would have gathered your children
together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you
would not! (38) Behold, <em class="HebMatt">
you will leave</em>
 your hous<em class="HebMatt">es</em>
desolate. (39) For I say unto you, you shall not see me hereafter until
you shall say, &lsquo;Blessed is he that comes in the name of <em class="HebMatt">
our savior --</em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
he that comes in the name of Yahweh</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Four</h2>

<p>[John 8:1] Jesus went unto the mount of
Olives. [John 8:2] And early in the morning he came again into the
temple, and all the people came to him. And he sat down, and taught
them. [John 8:3] And the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman
taken in <em class="GospHebrews">
many sins</em> of adultery. And
having set her in the midst, [John 8:4] they said to him,
&ldquo;Teacher, this woman has been taken in adultery, in the very act.
[John 8:5] Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such a person.
What then do you say about her? [John 8:6] And this they said, trying
him, that they might have something to accuse him about. But Jesus
stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. [John 8:7] But
when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up, and said to them,
&ldquo;He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone
at her.&rdquo; [John 8:8] And again he stooped down, and with his
finger wrote on the ground. [John 8:9] And they, when they heard it,
went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. And
Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst. [John
8:10] And Jesus lifted himself up, and said to her, &ldquo;Woman, where
are they? Does no man condemn you?&rdquo; [John 8: 11] And she said,
&ldquo;No man, Lord.&rdquo; And Jesus said, &ldquo;Neither will I
condemn you. Go your way. From now on sin no more.&rdquo; (1) And Jesus
went out from the Temple, and was going on his way back to the mount of
Olives. And his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the
Temple. (2) But he answered and said to them, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
see all these things? <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Amen</em>
 I tell you, there shall not be left here one <em class="Tillet">
stone upon stone</em>.&rdquo; (3)  And as he sat on the mount of Olives <em class="HebMatt">
opposite the Temple</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
Peter, John, and Andrew</em>
 came to him privately, saying, &ldquo;Tell us, <em class="Tillet">
what sign shall be at your coming</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="Tillet">
and </em>
at<em class="Tillet">
 the end of the world</em>?&rdquo; (4) And Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Take heed that
no man lead you astray. (5) For many shall come in My Name saying
&lsquo;I am <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
He</em>, the <em class="HebMatt">
Messiah&rsquo;</em>
 -- &lsquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">
I am Christ</em>' [<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e</span>., an imposter Jesus Christ, as Jesus restates in verses 23-27 below] and shall <em class="Tillet">
deceive </em>
and lead <em class="HebMatt">
you</em>
 astray. (6) And you shall hear of wars and <em class="HebMatt">
rumors</em>
 of wars. See that you are not <em class="HebMatt">
foolish</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
dismayed</em>
for these things must come to pass. But the end is not yet. (7) For
nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And
there shall be <em class="Tillet">
pestilence</em>, famines and earthquakes in various places. (8) But all these things are the beginning of travail. (9) Then shall they <em class="Tillet">
give you over to </em>
 tribulation, and shall kill you: and you shall be hated of all the nations, that is the Gentiles  <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
because of My Name</em>. (10) And then shall many <em class="HebMatt">
be perturbed</em>
 and shall <em class="HebMatt">
deal treacherously</em>
 with <em class="Tillet">
his neighbor</em>, and shall be <em class="HebMatt">
enraged </em>
<em class="Tillet">
against his</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="Tillet">
brother</em>. (11) And many false prophets shall arise, and shall lead many astray. (12) <em class="HebMatt">
When</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
apostasy</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
iniquity</em>
 shall <em class="Tillet">
abound</em>, the <em class="M&uuml;nster">
charity</em>
 and love of the many <em class="HebMatt">
shall grow faint</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
cold</em>. (13) But he that <em class="M&uuml;nster">
remains standing firm</em>
 and<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="AramaicGosp">
patiently</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 waits until</em>
 the end, the same shall be saved and <em class="AramaicGosp">
have life</em>. (14) And this gospel of the kingdom [<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, of the imposter using
Jesus&rsquo; name in verses 5,23-27 whom the apostate false prophets
promote in verses 11-12] shall be preached in the whole world for a
testimony to all the <em class="Tillet">
Gentiles</em>
-- the nations --<em class="HebMatt">
concerning me</em>, and then shall the end come. 	(15) <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
So</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 this is the Anti-Christ </em>
[<span style="font-weight: bold;">i.e</span>., the imposter using Jesus&rsquo; name in vv. 5, 14, 23-27]<em class="HebMatt">
and this is the abomination that desolates which was spoken of by
Daniel as standing in the holy place. (Let the one who reads
understand.)</em>
 (16) Then let them that are in <em class="Tillet">
Judah</em>
flee to the mountains. (17) Let him that is on the housetop not go down
to take out things that are in his house. (18) And let him that is in
the field not return back to take his <em class="Tillet">
clothes</em>. (19) But woe unto them that are <em class="Tillet">
about to bear</em>
 a child and to them that <em class="HebMatt">
nurse children</em>
 in those days! (20) And pray <em class="HebMatt">
to God</em>
that your flight is not in the winter, neither on a Sabbath, (21) for
then shall be great tribulation, such as has not been from the
beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be <em class="Tillet">
after it</em>. (22) And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But for <em class="HebMatt">
the chosen&rsquo;s</em>
 sake, those days shall be shortened. (23) If any man shall say to you, &lsquo;Lo, here is the <em class="HebMatt">
Messiah</em>&nbsp;or, Here,&rsquo; don&rsquo;t believe it. (24) For there shall arise false <em class="HebMatt">
messiahs</em>, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, <em class="HebMatt">
so that, if it can be, they will come to lead</em>
 astray <em class="HebMatt">
the chosen</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
(26)</em>
  If therefore they shall say to you, &lsquo;Behold, he is in the <em class="M&uuml;nster">
desert</em>
or wilderness,&rsquo; do not go out to see; or if they shall say
&lsquo;Behold, he is in the inner rooms,&rsquo; don&rsquo;t believe it.
(27) For as the lightning comes forth from the east, and is seen even
unto the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of Man. (28) Wherever
the <em class="HebMatt">
body</em> is, there will the <em class="HebMatt">
vultures</em>
 be gathered together. <em class="HebMatt">
(25)</em>
Behold, I have told you beforehand. (29) After the tribulation of those
days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the <em class="HebMatt">
host</em>
 of the heavens shall be shaken. (30) And then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s.</em>
 And then shall all the <em class="HebMatt">
families</em>
 of the land mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
many warriors</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt-nccg">a very great fortification</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
with dreadful appearance</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
great power and glory</em>. (31) And he shall send his angels with a trumpet, and <em class="HebMatt">
with a great shout</em>
 shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the <em class="Tillet">
heights</em>
 of heaven to the <em class="M&uuml;nster">
farthest ends</em>. (32)  Now from the fig tree learn her parable. <em class="HebMatt">
When you see its branches and leaves sprouting</em>, <em class="Tillet">
you know that the ripe fruit is near. </em>
(33) <em class="Tillet">
So likewise you, when you shall see all these things</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
know that he is near the gates</em>, <em class="Tillet">
even at the doors</em>. (34) <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Amen</em>
 I tell you, this <em class="UnderlineBold">
race [mankind? Jews?]</em>
 shall not pass away until all these things be accomplished. (35) Heaven and earth shall pass away <em class="M&uuml;nster">
but my words shall not pass away</em>. (36) <em class="Tillet">
Of that day and concerning that  hour</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
there shall be no man that knows</em>. Only the Father knows.&rdquo; (37) <em class="HebMatt">
And Jesus said to his disciples</em>, &ldquo;And as were the days of Noah, so shall be the coming of the
Son of Man. (38) For as in those days which were before the flood they
were eating and drinking, <em class="HebMatt">
being fruitful and multiplying</em>, until the day that Noah entered into the ark. (39) And they did not
know the end was near until the flood came, and took them all away. So
shall be the coming of the Son of Man. (40) Then shall two men be in
the field, <em class="HebMatt">
one righteous and the other evil</em>; <em class="HebMatt">
the </em>
one is taken, and <em class="HebMatt">
the other</em>
 is left: (41) <em class="Tillet">
two shall be in one bed; one shall be taken, and one shall be left</em>;&nbsp;two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and <em class="HebMatt">
the other</em>
 is left.  <em class="HebMatt">
This is because the angels at the end of the world will remove the
stumbling blocks from the world and will separate the good from the
evil.</em>
&rdquo; (42) <em class="HebMatt">
Then Jesus said to his disciples</em>, &ldquo;<em class="Tillet">Be therefore alert</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
vigilant!</em>
 For you do not know <em class="Tillet">
at</em>
 what <em class="HebMatt">
hour</em>
 your Lord will come. (43) <em class="HebMatt">
This you know</em>, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, <em class="Tillet">
in truth</em>
 he would have <em class="Tillet">
been alert</em>
 and<em class="M&uuml;nster">
 vigilant</em>, and would not have suffered his house to be broken into. (44) Therefore also be <em class="Tillet">
ready</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
because you do not know at what hour the Son of Man is going to come</em>. (45) <em class="HebMatt">
What do you think of the</em>
 <em class="UnderlineBold">
obedient</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
prudent</em>
 servant whom his lord has set over <em class="HebMatt">
the children</em>
 to give them their <em class="Tillet">
bread</em>
 in <em class="HebMatt">
its time</em>? (46) Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds him doing so when he comes.  (47) <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Amen</em>, I tell you that <em class="HebMatt">
he will place him over </em>
<em class="Tillet">
all his substance</em>. (48) But if that servant shall say <em class="Tillet">
wickedly</em>
 in his heart, &lsquo;My lord tarries <em class="Tillet">
to come</em>,&rsquo; (49) and shall begin to beat <em class="Tillet">
the</em>
 servants <em class="Tillet">
which are with him</em>, and shall eat and drink with <em class="HebMatt">
gluttons</em>; (50) the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he <em class="HebMatt">
is not expecting</em>, and <em class="HebMatt">
at a time</em>
when he does not know he is coming. (51) And his lord shall cut him
asunder, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be
the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Five</h2>

<p>(1) <em class="HebMatt">
Again Jesus said to his disciples</em>, &ldquo;Then shall the kingdom of heaven be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom <em class="HebMatt">
and a bride</em>. (2) And five of them were <em class="HebMatt">
lazy fools</em>, and five were <em class="HebMatt">
alert and</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
prudent</em>. (3)  For the <em class="HebMatt">
five</em>
 foolish, when they took their lamps, they took no oil with them (4)  but the <em class="Tillet">
prudent</em>
 took oil in their vessels with their lamps. (5) Now while the bridegroom <em class="Tillet">
was delayed</em>, they all <em class="HebMatt">
lingered</em>
 and slept. (6) But at midnight there is a cry, &lsquo;Behold, the bridegroom! Come out <em class="Tillet">
now</em>
 to meet him.&rsquo; (7) Then all those virgins arose, and <em class="Tillet">
made ready</em>
 their lamps.  (8) And the foolish said to the <em class="Tillet">
prudent</em>, &lsquo;Give us of your oil. For our lamps <em class="HebMatt">
have gone out</em>.&rsquo; (9)  But the <em class="Tillet">
prudent</em>
 answered, saying, &lsquo;<em class="Tillet">We may not give you</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
because</em>
there will not be enough for both us and you. Go rather to them that
sell, and buy for yourselves.&rsquo; (10) And while they went away to
buy, the bridegroom came. And they that were ready went in with him to
the <em class="AramaicGosp">
banquet-hall</em>. And the door was <em class="AramaicGosp">
locked</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
closed</em>.  (11) Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, &lsquo;<em class="HebMatt">Our</em>
 Lord, <em class="Tillet">
Lord</em>
! Open to us.&rsquo; (12) But he answered and said, &lsquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">Amen</em>
 I tell you, I do not know you.&rsquo; (13) <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
And therefore you</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
be careful</em>, <em class="AramaicGosp">
alert </em>
and<em class="AramaicGosp">
 </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
vigilant!</em>
 For you do not know the day nor the hour <em class="HebMatt">
when the bridegroom will come</em>.&rdquo; (14) <em class="HebMatt">
Again Jesus told his disciples another example</em>, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heaven<em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>
 is like a man going <em class="GospHebrews">
on a </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
far</em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
 </em>
<em class="Tillet">
seafaring</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
journey</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
to a strange country</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
abroad. </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
He</em>
 called his own servants, and delivered to them his <em class="HebMatt">
money.</em>
 (15)  And to one he gave <em class="HebMatt">
five coins of gold</em>, to another two <em class="HebMatt">
coins of gold</em>, and lastly he gave one coin of gold to another; to each according to <em class="GospHebrews">
his ability</em>
--<em class="HebMatt">
what was suitable for him</em>. And he went on his journey. (16) Immediately he that <em class="M&uuml;nster">
accepted</em>
 the five <em class="HebMatt">
coins of gold</em>
 went and traded with them, and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
acquired</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
five </em>
more<em class="HebMatt">
 gold coins.</em>
 (17) He that <em class="M&uuml;nster">
accepted</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
two gold coins</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
went at once and squandered the substance with harlots and flute-women</em>. (18) And he that received one gold coin went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord&rsquo;s money <em class="Tillet">
in the hole he dug. </em>
 (19) Now after a long time the lord of those servants returned, and made an accounting with them. (20) And he that <em class="M&uuml;nster">
had accepted</em>
 the five <em class="HebMatt">
gold coins</em>
 came <em class="HebMatt">
near</em>, saying, &lsquo;Lord, you delivered to me five talents, <em class="M&uuml;nster">
and here are ten, including another five</em>
 which I have gained <em class="HebMatt">
for you</em>.&rsquo; (21) His lord said to him, &ldquo;Well done. <em class="HebMatt">
Truly you are a</em>
 good and <em class="UnderlineBold">
obedient</em>
 servant. You have been <em class="UnderlineBold">
trustworthy</em>
 over a few things. I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord. (22) He that <em class="M&uuml;nster">
accepted</em>
 the two <em class="HebMatt">
gold coins </em>
and squandered them on harlots and flute women <em class="GospHebrews">
was shut up in prison.</em>
 (30) His Lord said: &lsquo;And cast out this <em class="GospHebrews">
worthless</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
lazy</em>
 servant into <em class="GospHebrews">
prison</em>
 in <em class="HebMatt">
the lowest places</em>. There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.&rsquo; (24) And he also that had <em class="M&uuml;nster">
accepted</em>
 the one gold coin came <em class="HebMatt">
near</em>
 and said, &lsquo;Lord, I knew that you are a <em class="HebMatt">
firm and</em>
hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did
not scatter. (25) And I was afraid, and went away and hid your <em class="HebMatt">
coin of gold</em>
in the earth. Here, you have back your gold coin as your own.&rsquo;
(26) But his lord answered and said to him, &lsquo;You wicked and lazy
servant. You knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gathered where I
did not scatter. (27) You ought therefore to have put my money to <em class="HebMatt">
my money-changers</em>, and at my return I should have received back mine own with <em class="HebMatt">
profit</em>. (28) Take away therefore the <em class="HebMatt">
coin of gold</em>
 from him, and give it to him that has the ten gold coins.&rsquo; (29) For to everyone that has shall <em class="GospHebrews">
more </em>
be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him that does not have any profit to show, even that which <em class="GospHebrews">
he has</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
was intended for him</em>
 shall be taken away.&rdquo; (31) <em class="HebMatt">
And again Jesus said to his disciples</em>, &ldquo;But when the Son of Man shall come in his <em class="HebMatt">
revelation</em>, and all the angels with him, then he shall sit on <em class="Tillet">
his glorious</em>
 throne.  (32) And before him shall be gathered all the nations. And he shall separate <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
between</em>
 them one from another, <em class="Tillet">
these from those</em>
as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. (33) And he shall
set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left <em class="Tillet">
hand</em>. (34) Then shall <em class="HebMatt">
he</em>
 say to them on his right hand, &lsquo;Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the <em class="HebMatt">
creation</em>
 of the world <em class="HebMatt">
until now.</em>
 (35) For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a <em class="HebMatt">
wayfarer</em>, and you took me in. (36) Naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and
you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me.&rsquo; (37) Then
shall the righteous <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
ones</em>
 answer him, saying, &lsquo;<em class="HebMatt">Oh our</em>
 Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you? Or thirsty, and gave you something to drink? (38) <em class="Tillet">
And </em>
when did we<em class="Tillet">
 see you a stranger and took you in?</em>
Or naked, and clothed you? (39) And when did we see you sick, or in
prison, and came to you?&rsquo; (40) And the King shall answer and say
to them, &lsquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">Amen</em>
  I tell you, <em class="HebMatt">
every time</em>
 you did it to one <em class="HebMatt">
of the needy</em>
 of these <em class="Tillet">
which are </em>
<em class="HebMatt">
my</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
brothers </em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
even the little ones like these</em>, <em class="Tillet">
it is as if</em>
 you have done it to me.&rsquo;  (41) Then he shall also say to them on the left hand, &lsquo;Depart from me, you cursed, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
and </em>
<em class="Tillet">
get </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 </em>
 into the eternal fire<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 </em>
--<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
 the place</em>
 prepared for <em class="HebMatt">
Satan </em>
and his angels. (42) <em class="HebMatt">
Because </em>
I was hungry, and you did not give me anything to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink. (43) I was a <em class="HebMatt">
wayfarer</em>, and you did not take me in. Naked, and you did not clothe me. Sick,
and in prison, and you did not visit me.&rsquo; (44) Then shall they
also answer, saying, &lsquo;<em class="HebMatt">Oh our </em>
Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a <em class="HebMatt">
wayfarer</em>, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not <em class="HebMatt">
serve </em>
you?&rsquo; (45) Then shall he answer them, saying, &lsquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">Amen</em>
 I tell you, <em class="HebMatt">
whenever</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
you </em>
 <em class="AramaicGosp">
neglected to do so</em>
 to <em class="HebMatt">
these needy</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
even the little ones like these</em>, you did not do it to me.&rsquo; (46) And these shall go away into eternal <em class="Tillet">
punishment</em>
 but the righteous into eternal life.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Six</h2>

<p>(1) And it came to pass, when Jesus had
finished all these words, he said to his disciples, (2) &ldquo;You know
that after two days the Passover arrives, and the Son of Man is <em class="Tillet">
betrayed and </em>
delivered up <em class="M&uuml;nster">
to be crucified</em>.&rdquo; (3) Then were gathered together the <em class="HebMatt">
rulers of </em>
the priests, <em class="AramaicGosp">
the scribes</em>, and the <em class="HebMatt">
great ones</em>
 of the people, at the court of the high priest, who was called <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Kayafa</em>.  (4) And they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by <em class="HebMatt">
craftiness</em>
 and kill him.  (5) But they said, &ldquo;Not during the <em class="M&uuml;nster">
solemn day</em>
of the feast, otherwise a tumult will arise among the people.&rdquo;
(6) Now when Jesus was in the City of Bet-Hananya / Bethany, in the
house of Simon the jarmaker, (7) there came to him a woman having a <em class="HebMatt">
flask</em>
 of <em class="HebMatt">
costly</em>
 <em class="AramaicGosp">
aromatic</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
oil</em>, and she poured it upon his head, as he <em class="HebMatt">
was reclining at the table</em>. (8) <em class="HebMatt">
But </em>
the disciples<em class="HebMatt">
 grumbled</em>, and became<em class="AramaicGosp">
 upset</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
indignant</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
over</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
this waste.</em>
 (9) For this <em class="M&uuml;nster">
oil</em>
 might have been sold for <em class="HebMatt">
a great price</em>, and given to the poor. (10) But Jesus <em class="HebMatt">
who knows everything in regard to any matter done</em>, said to them, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Are you making an accusation against this woman? </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
In truth</em>, she has done a good <em class="HebMatt">
and marvelous</em>
 work for me. (11) For you have the poor always with you. But you do not always have me. (12) <em class="HebMatt">
Her placing this </em>
<em class="Tillet">
oil</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 on my body refers to my burial.</em>
 (13) <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Amen</em>
 I tell you, wherever this <em class="HebMatt">
Good-News</em>
 shall be preached in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be spoken about <em class="M&uuml;nster">
in memory of her</em>.&rdquo; (14) Then one of the twelve, who was called <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Yehudah</em>
 Iscariot went to the chief <em class="HebMatt">
religious officers</em>, (15) and said, &ldquo;What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?&rdquo; And they <em class="AramaicGosp">
promised him</em>
 thirty pieces of silver. (16) And from that time he sought <em class="M&uuml;nster">
an opportune time</em>
 to deliver him to them. (17) Now on the first day of unleavened bread known as <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Chag HaMatzot</em>
the disciples came to Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Where do you wish that we
prepare for you to eat the Passover?&rdquo; (17.1) Jesus answered,
&ldquo;<em class="Ebionite">
With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you</em>.&rdquo; (18)  And he said, &ldquo;Go into the city to <em class="HebMatt">
a certain</em>
 man <em class="HebMatt">
who will be a volunteer for the task</em>, and tell him, &lsquo;The Teacher says, My time is <em class="HebMatt">
near</em>. I along with my disciples keep the Passover <em class="HebMatt">
with you</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo; (19) And the disciples did as Jesus asked them. And
they made ready the passover. (20) Now when evening was come, he was
sitting at a meal <em class="M&uuml;nster">
at a table</em>
 with the twelve disciples. (21) And as they were eating, he said, &ldquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">Amen</em>
 I tell you, that one of you shall <em class="HebMatt">
inform against</em>
 me.&rdquo;  (22) And they were very saddened, and began to ask him <em class="HebMatt">
each </em>
one, &lsquo;Is it I, Lord?&rsquo;  (23)  And he answered and said, &ldquo;He that <em class="HebMatt">
dips</em>
 his hand with me in the dish, the same shall <em class="HebMatt">
sell</em>
 me.&rdquo; <em class="HebMatt">
All of them were eating from one dish. Therefore, they did not
recognize him, because if they had recognized him, they would have
destroyed him.</em>
 (24) &ldquo;The Son of Man goes <em class="AramaicGosp">
to his fate</em>, even as it is written of him: but woe to that man through whom the
Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he
had never been born.&rdquo; (25) And Judas who <em class="HebMatt">
sold</em>
 him, answered and said, &ldquo;<em class="AramaicGosp">Perhaps</em>
 it is I, Rabbi?&rdquo; He replied to him, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">You have said </em>
it<em class="HebMatt">.</em>&rdquo; (26) And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed God, and <em class="HebMatt">
divided it</em>, and he gave it to the disciples, and said, &ldquo;Take, eat! This is my body.&rdquo; (27) And he took a cup, and gave<em class="HebMatt">
 praise</em><em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 to his Father</em>, and gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink <em class="HebMatt">
from this</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
all of you</em>; (28) for this is my blood of the <em class="HebMatt">
new</em>
 covenant, which <em class="HebMatt">
will be</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
sacrificially</em>
 poured out for many for the <em class="HebMatt">
atonement</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
of sinners</em>. (29) But I tell you, I shall not drink from this time forward of this
fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in <em class="HebMatt">
the</em>
 kingdom <em class="HebMatt">
of</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
the</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
heaven</em><em class="HebMatt-nccg">s</em>.&rdquo; (30) <em class="Tillet">
And when they had recited </em>
a<em class="Tillet">
 psalm</em>, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
they returned</em>
 and they went out to the mount of Olives. (31) Then Jesus told them, &ldquo;Come all of you, you will <em class="HebMatt">
 be grieved </em>
at<em class="HebMatt">
 me </em>
this night. For it is written, &lsquo;I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.&rsquo; (32) But <em class="HebMatt">
after my resurrection from death</em>, I will <em class="HebMatt">
be revealed to </em>
you in Galilee.&rdquo; (33) But Peter answered and said to him, &ldquo;If all shall be <em class="HebMatt">
angry with</em>
 you and <em class="AramaicGosp">
lose faith in you</em>, I will never <em class="HebMatt">
be grieved</em>
 at you or <em class="AramaicGosp">
lose faith in you</em>.&rdquo; (34) Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Truly I tell you that this
night, before the cock crows, you shall deny me three times.&rdquo;
(35) Peter responded to him, &ldquo;Even if <em class="HebMatt">
it is arranged for me that</em>
I must die with you, yet will I not deny you.&rdquo; All the disciples
said also the same thing. (36) Then Jesus went with them to a place
called <em class="Tillet">
Geshemanim</em>, and said to his disciples, &ldquo;Sit
here while I go over there to pray.&rdquo; (37) And he took with him
Peter and the two sons of Zebedee<em class="HebMatt">l</em>, and began to be sorrowful, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
grieved </em>
 <em class="Tillet">
and downcast</em>. (38) Then he said to them, &ldquo;My soul is <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
more than</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
grieving unto death</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
Support me</em>, and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
keep watch</em>
 with me.&rdquo; (39) And he <em class="HebMatt">
slowly</em>
 went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, &ldquo;My Father, if <em class="M&uuml;nster">
it is</em>
 possible, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
please</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
take this cup from me</em>. Nevertheless, <em class="HebMatt">
let it not be </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
according</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 as I will but </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
only</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 according to your will</em>.&rdquo;<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
(39.1) <em class="GospHebrews">
And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him</em>. (40) And he returned to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, &ldquo;What, you couldn&rsquo;t be <em class="M&uuml;nster">
vigilant</em>
 and <em class="AramaicGosp">
stay awake</em>
 with me one hour?  (41) <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Be</em>
 <em class="M&uuml;nster">
vigilant</em>
 and pray that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing <em class="HebMatt">
to go to its creator</em>, but the flesh is weak <em class="HebMatt">
and sick</em>. But <em class="Agrapha">
that which is weak shall be saved through that which is strong</em>.&rdquo; (42)  Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, &ldquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">My Father, if this cup cannot pass unless I drink it</em>,<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
your will be done.</em>&rdquo; (43) And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes
were heavy. (44) And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a
third time, saying <em class="M&uuml;nster">
the same prayer</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
as he had said already</em>. (45) Then he returned to the disciples, and told them, &ldquo;Sleep
on now, and take your rest.&rdquo; After a while, Jesus warned them,
saying: &ldquo;Behold, <em class="HebMatt">
the time has come near</em>, and the Son of Man is <em class="HebMatt">
delivered</em>
 into the hands of sinners. (46) Arise, let us be going. Behold, he is at hand that betrays <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
me</em>.&rdquo; (47) And while he still was speaking, Judas, one of the twelve <em class="HebMatt">
disciples</em>, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and <em class="Tillet">
spears</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
whips</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
clubs</em>, who came from the chief priest and <em class="HebMatt">
the princes</em>
 of the people. (48) Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, &ldquo;Whomever I shall kiss <em class="HebMatt">
is the one you should arrest</em>.&rdquo; (49) And directly he came to Jesus, and said, &ldquo;<em class="Tillet">Shalom</em>
 Rabbi.&rdquo; And <em class="HebMatt">
then he</em>
 kissed him. (50) And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">
My</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
dear </em>
Friend, <em class="HebMatt">
what have you done</em>? <em class="M&uuml;nster">
To what end have you come?</em>
&rdquo; Then they came <em class="Tillet">
near</em>
 and grabbed Jesus, and <em class="Tillet">
seized him</em>. (51) And one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of <em class="HebMatt">
one of </em>
the priest<em class="HebMatt">s</em>, and struck off his ear. (52) Then Jesus told him, &ldquo;Put up again your sword into its place. For all they that <em class="HebMatt">
draw</em>
 the sword shall <em class="M&uuml;nster">
perish</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
by the sword</em>. (53) <em class="HebMatt">
Do you not understand I </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
am able to meet</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 my enemies </em>
<em class="Tillet">
if I asked my Father</em>? <em class="HebMatt">
And indeed there will be for me</em>
 more than twelve legions of angels? (54) <em class="Tillet">
But</em>
 how then should the scriptures be fulfilled what<em class="HebMatt">
 is intended to be done?</em>&rdquo; (55) In that <em class="Tillet">
same</em>
 hour Jesus said to the crowd, &ldquo;Have you come out as against robber<em class="HebMatt">s</em>
 with swords and <em class="Tillet">
spears</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
whips</em>
 and <em class="M&uuml;nster">
clubs</em>
 to seize me? I sat daily <em class="Tillet">
beside you</em>
 in the temple teaching <em class="HebMatt">
you</em>, and you did not take me. (56) But all this is come to pass <em class="Tillet">
to establish</em>
 the <em class="HebMatt">
writings </em>
of the prophets.&rdquo; Then all the disciples left him, and fled. (57) <em class="Tillet">
So they seized Jesus</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
and</em>
 led him away to the house of <em class="Tillet">
Kaiaphah</em>, the high priest where the scribes and <em class="HebMatt">
Pharisees</em>
 were gathered together. (58) But Peter followed him afar off to the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the <em class="HebMatt">
guards</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
servants</em>
 to see the end. (59) Now the chief priests and <em class="HebMatt">
the Pharisees</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
and the whole council</em>
 sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death.  (60) And they found <em class="HebMatt">
not even one</em>, though many false witnesses came <em class="Tillet">
forward</em>. But afterward came <em class="HebMatt">
forward</em>
 two <em class="HebMatt">
false witnesses</em>, (61) and said, &ldquo;This man said I am able to destroy the Temple of God, and to <em class="HebMatt">
repair</em>
 it in three days.&rdquo; (62) And the high priest stood up, and said to him, &ldquo;Do you answer nothing to what these witness<em class="HebMatt">
es</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
are bearing</em>
 against you?&rdquo; (63) But Jesus <em class="HebMatt">
answered not a word</em>. And the high priest said to him, &ldquo;I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the <em class="HebMatt">
Messiah</em>, the Son of God.&rdquo; (64) Jesus said to him, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">You said it.</em>
 Nevertheless I <em class="HebMatt">
again</em>
 say to you, <em class="HebMatt">
you have yet to see</em>
 the Son of <em class="Tillet">
Man</em>
 sitting at the right hand of Yahweh<em class="UnderlineBold">
<a href="ogm2014.htm#pgfId-633637" class="footnote"></a></em>and coming on the clouds of heaven.&rdquo; (65) Then the high priest tore his garments, saying, &ldquo;He has <em class="HebMatt">
cursed God</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
blasphemed</em>. What further need do we have of witnesses? You have now heard <em class="HebMatt">
how he cursed God</em>. (66) What do you think <em class="HebMatt">
can be done</em>?&rdquo; They answered and said, &ldquo;He is worthy of death.&rdquo;
(67) Then they spit in his face and some smote him with the <em class="Tillet">
fist</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
on his back</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
and others slapped him in the face</em>, (68) saying, &ldquo;Prophesy for us, you <em class="HebMatt">
Messiah</em>. Who is it that <em class="UnderlineBold">
just</em>
 struck you?&rdquo; (69) Now Peter was sitting <em class="HebMatt">
at the entrance of</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
the courtyard</em>
 and a <em class="Tillet">
maid-servant</em>
 came to him, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Were</em>
 you <em class="HebMatt">
not</em>
 also <em class="HebMatt">
standing</em>
 with Jesus the Galilean<em class="HebMatt">?</em>&rdquo; (70) But <em class="HebMatt">
Peter </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
denied unto</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 her</em>, saying, &ldquo;I do not know  what you are talking about.&rdquo; (71) And when he was gone out into the porch, another <em class="Tillet">
maid-servant</em>
 saw him, and said to them that were there, &ldquo;This man also was <em class="HebMatt">
standing</em>
 with Jesus <em class="Tillet">
the Nazarene</em>.&rdquo; (72) And again he denied Jesus with an oath, <em class="Tillet">
and said, &ldquo;I do not know him.&rdquo; </em>
(73) And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, &ldquo;Truly you also are <em class="HebMatt">
from this prophet&rsquo;s group</em>
 for <em class="HebMatt">
it is clear from your</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
accent.</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
Your tongue betrays you.</em>&rdquo; (74) Then he began <em class="HebMatt">
to deny</em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
 </em>
and swear<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
--&ldquo;<em class="GospHebrews">
I know not the man</em>&nbsp;.&rdquo;<em class="GospHebrews">
 </em>
And <em class="Tillet">
immediately</em>
the cock crowed. (75) And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had
said, &ldquo;Before the cock crows, you shall deny me three
times.&rdquo; And he went out<em class="HebMatt">
side</em>, and wept <em class="HebMatt">
with bitterness of soul</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Seven</h2>

<p>(1)  Now when morning came, all the chief<em class="HebMatt">
 sages</em>
 and the elders of the people <em class="Tillet">
were in conclave together</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
concerning</em>
 Jesus to <em class="HebMatt">
surely</em>
 put him<em class="Tillet">
 </em>
to death. (2) And they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to <em class="HebMatt">
Pontius</em>
 Pilate, the governor. (3) Then Judas <em class="HebMatt">
Iscariot</em>, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, <em class="HebMatt">
began to turn in repentance</em>
 and brought back the thirty <em class="HebMatt">
dinars</em>
 to the <em class="HebMatt">
high</em>
 priest and elders <em class="HebMatt">
of the people</em>, (4) saying, &ldquo;I have sinned in that <em class="HebMatt">
I have </em>
<em class="Tillet">
betrayed</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
the blood of the righteous</em>.&rdquo; But they said, &ldquo;What is that to us? You see to it.&rdquo; (5) And he cast down the <em class="HebMatt">
coins</em>
 into the <em class="HebMatt">
temple</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
treasury chest</em>, and departed. And he went away <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
and took for himself a rope </em>
and hanged himself. (6) And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, &ldquo;It is not lawful to put <em class="HebMatt">
these coins</em>
 into the temple treasury, since it is the <em class="Tillet">
reward</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
given for the blood of Jesus</em>.&rdquo;  (7) And they took counsel, and bought with them the field of <em class="HebMatt">
a certain</em>
 potter <em class="HebMatt">
of clay</em>, to bury strangers in.  (8)  As a result, that field was called the field of blood -- <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Hakal Dama</em>
 -- until this day. (9) Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through <em class="HebMatt">
Zechariah</em>
 the prophet, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">I
said to them: if it is good in your eyes, multiply my wages, but if
not, forebear. So they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver</em>.&rdquo;<em class="HebMatt">
 Then Yahweh  said to me: </em>
&ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Cast it unto the potter</em>.&rdquo; <em class="HebMatt">
This is for the man who forms clay. </em>
(10.1) And as the prophet <em class="Tillet">
Jeremiah said, </em>
&ldquo;<em class="Tillet">And they took the thirty pieces of silver, a goodly price of him that
was valued, whom they valued of the children of Israel; and </em>
(10)<em class="Tillet">
 gave them for the potter&rsquo;s portion,</em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
 </em>
as <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Yahweh</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
commanded</em>
 me.&rdquo; (11) Now Jesus stood before <em class="HebMatt">
Pilate</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
who</em>
 asked him, &ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&rdquo; And Jesus replied, &ldquo;You said it.&rdquo; (12) And when he was <em class="Tillet">
slandered</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
harassed</em>
 by the chief priests and elders <em class="HebMatt">
with regard to some word they spoke against him</em>, he answered nothing. (13) Then Pilate said to him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you hear the many things they testify against you?&rdquo; (14) And he
gave him no answer, and <em class="HebMatt">
Pilate</em>
 greatly marveled. (15) <em class="HebMatt">
And </em>
at<em class="HebMatt">
 the honored feast of the Passover</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
it was the custom of the commander of the city to give</em>
  to the crowds one prisoner <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
from among the prisoners</em>, whom<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
ever</em>
 they <em class="HebMatt">
wished</em>. (16) <em class="HebMatt">
Pilate had a prisoner who was almost crazy</em>
 called <em class="GreekVariants">
Jesus</em>
 the <em class="GospHebrews">
Son of the Teacher</em>
 --<em class="Tillet">
Bar-Rabba</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
taken in a case of murder </em>
<em class="GospHebrews">
and sedition</em>,<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
and<em class="HebMatt">
 he had placed him in a dungeon.</em>
 (17) When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Whom do you wish that I should release to you? <em class="GreekVariants">
Jesus</em>
 the <em class="GospHebrews">
Son of the Teacher</em>
--<em class="Tillet">
Bar-Rabba</em>, or Jesus who is called <em class="HebMatt">
Messiah</em>?&rdquo; (18) For he knew that for <em class="Tillet">
hatred</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
without cause</em>
 they had delivered him up. (19) And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him <em class="HebMatt">
a messenger</em>, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">I implore you</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
that in no matter should you speak a word against this</em>
 righteous man. For I have suffered many things this day in a <em class="HebMatt">
vision </em>
because of him.&rdquo; (20) Now the chief priests and the elders <em class="HebMatt">
of the Law </em>
persuaded the crowds that they should ask for the <em class="GospHebrews">
Son of the Teacher</em>
--<em class="Tillet">
Bar-Rabba</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
that Jesus might die</em>. (21) But the governor answered and said to them, &ldquo;Which of the two do you wish that I release to you? And they said, <em class="GospHebrews">
&ldquo;Son of the Teacher&rdquo;</em>
--<em class="Tillet">
Bar-Rabba</em>.&rdquo; (22)  Pilate  said to them, &ldquo;What then shall I do to Jesus who is called <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Mashiach</em>?&rdquo; They all said, &ldquo;Let him be <em class="HebMatt">
hung</em>.&rdquo; (23) And he said, &ldquo;Why? What evil has he done?&rdquo; But they greatly cried out, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Let them hang him</em>
! <em class="HebMatt">
Let them hang him! Let them hang him</em>!&rdquo; (24) So when Pilate saw that he had <em class="HebMatt">
no power of resistance</em>
 and <em class="Tillet">
prevailed nothing</em>
 but rather that a <em class="Tillet">
great</em>
 tumult was rising, he took water, and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, &ldquo;I am innocent of the blood of <em class="Tillet">
this righteous man</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
Be careful what you do. </em>
 <em class="Tillet">
See you to it</em>.&rdquo;  (25) And all the crowd answered and said, &ldquo;His blood be on us, and <em class="HebMatt">
upon our seed</em>.&rdquo; (26) Then he released <em class="Tillet">
Bar-Rabbah</em>
 to them. But he <em class="HebMatt">
delivered to them</em>
 Jesus <em class="HebMatt">
for beating and affliction </em>
<em class="Tillet">
with whips</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 that they might hang him</em>. (27) Then the <em class="Tillet">
soldiers of the governor</em>
-- the <em class="HebMatt">
horsemen of the court</em>
-- took Jesus <em class="HebMatt">
under guard</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
and delivered him to them in the court of justice</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
where<em class="HebMatt">
 a great company had come together. </em>
(28) <em class="Tillet">
And they stripped him</em>. They clothed him with <em class="HebMatt">
silk garments</em>
 and put on him <em class="HebMatt">
a greenish silk robe</em>. (29) And they <em class="Tillet">
encircled </em>
his head<em class="Tillet">
 with</em>
 a crown of thorns, and <em class="Tillet">
placed</em>
 a reed in his right hand. And they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Peace! Shalom be unto you!</em>
 King of the Jews!&rdquo; (30) And they spat <em class="HebMatt">
in his face</em>
and took the reed and hit him on the head. (31) And when they had
mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his <em class="HebMatt">
own</em>
 garments, and led him away to <em class="HebMatt">
hang</em>
 him. (32)  And as they came out <em class="HebMatt">
from the city</em>, they found Simon, a man <em class="Tillet">
of Cyrene</em>. They compelled him to <em class="HebMatt">
carry the </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
beam</em><em class="HebMatt">,</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
that is, &lsquo;the Cross.&rsquo;</em>
 (32.1) [Luke 23:27]<em class="Luke">
 And there followed him a great crowd of people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him. </em>
(32.2)<em class="Luke">
 </em>
[Luke 23:28]<em class="Luke">
But Jesus turning to them said, &ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem! Weep not
for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. </em>
(32.3)<em class="Luke">
 </em>
[Luke 23:29] <em class="Luke">
For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are
the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never
gave suck. </em>
(32.4)<em class="Luke">
 </em>
[Luke 23:30]<em class="Luke">
 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, &lsquo;Fall on us;&rsquo; and to the hills, &lsquo;Cover us.&rsquo; </em>
(32.5)<em class="Luke">
 </em>
[Luke 23:31]<em class="Luke">
 For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</em>
&rdquo; (33)  And they arrived at a place called <em class="Tillet">
Golgoltha </em>
that is to say, <em class="HebMatt">
Mount </em>
of the Skull<em class="HebMatt">. </em>
(34) They gave him wine <em class="Tillet">
mingled with opium</em>
 to drink. And when <em class="HebMatt">
he began to drink</em>, and <em class="Tillet">
had tasted it,</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
he perceived </em>
what it was and he would not drink. (35) And when they had <em class="HebMatt">
placed him on the gallows</em>, they parted his garments among themselves, casting lots. (36) <em class="Tillet">
And they sat down and guarded him</em>. (37) And they set up over his head <em class="HebMatt">
a writing</em>
 which said &ldquo;THIS IS <em class="HebMatt">
JESUS</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
OF </em>
<em class="GreekVariants">
NAZARA</em>, THE KING OF <em class="HebMatt">
ISRAEL</em>.&rdquo; (38) Then were crucified with him two robbers, one on the
right hand and one on the left. (39) And those who passed by <em class="Tillet">
were reviling him</em>, wagging their heads, (40) and saying, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">See how</em>
 you would  destroy the temple <em class="HebMatt">
of God</em>
 and in <em class="HebMatt">
yet</em>
 three days build it. Save yourself. If you are the Son of God, come down from <em class="HebMatt">
the gallows</em>.&rdquo; (41) In like manner also the chief priests mocking him, with the <em class="Tillet">
scribes and</em>
 elders, said, (42) &ldquo;He saved others. He cannot save himself. <em class="HebMatt">
If h</em>e is the King of Israel, let him now come down from <em class="HebMatt">
the tree</em>, and we will believe <em class="Tillet">
in him</em>.  (43)  He trusts on God. Let him deliver him now if he <em class="Tillet">
delights </em>
in him. For he said, &lsquo;I am the Son of God.&rsquo;&rdquo; (44) And the robbers also that were <em class="HebMatt">
hung</em>
 with him <em class="Tillet">
reproached him</em>
 with <em class="HebMatt">
these very same words</em>. (45.1) And Jesus prayed, <em class="GospHebrews">
&ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.&rdquo;
And because of this word of the Lord, many thousands of Jews and some
others who stood around the cross afterwards believed.</em>
(45) Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness
over all the land. (46) And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
mighty </em>
voice, <em class="HebMatt">
saying in the holy language</em>, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt-yaha">ELIY, ELIY, LAMAH AZABETANIY </em>, that is My God, My God,<em class="HebMatt-yaha">Why have you forsaken me?</em>
&rdquo; (47) And some of them standing there when they heard it said,
&ldquo;This man calls for Elijah.&rdquo; (48) And immediately one of
them ran, and took <em class="HebMatt">
spongy-bread</em>, and filled it with vinegar, and gave him to drink. (49) And the rest
said, &ldquo;Let us see whether Elijah comes to save him.&rdquo; (50)
And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and <em class="HebMatt">
sent</em>
 up his spirit <em class="HebMatt">
to his Father</em>. (51) <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
At once</em>, a <em class="GospHebrews">
massive lintel</em>
 of the temple was <em class="GospHebrews">
split in two</em>
 from the top to the bottom. And <em class="GospHebrews">
the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent.</em>
 (52) And the tombs were opened. And many bodies of <em class="HebMatt">
those</em>
 who had fallen asleep <em class="HebMatt">
in the dust</em>
 were raised. (53) And upon coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and were <em class="HebMatt">
revealed </em>
to many. (54)  Now the centurion, and they that were with him <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
to guard </em>
Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, were very fearful, saying, &ldquo;<em class="M&uuml;nster">Vere filius dei suit iste</em>,&rdquo; <em class="UnderlineBold">
which is Latin meaning</em>, &ldquo;Truly! This was the Son of God!&rdquo; (55)  And many women were there watching from a distance who had <em class="HebMatt">
served</em>
 Jesus from Galilee <em class="HebMatt">
until that time</em>, <em class="M&uuml;nster">
ministering to him</em>. (56) Among them was <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Mary from Magdala</em>, and Mary <em class="Tillet">
the daughter</em>
 of James, and <em class="Tillet">
the mother of</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
Joseph</em>, and the mother of the sons of <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Zavdai</em>. (57) And when evening arrived, there came a rich man from <em class="Tillet">
Ha-Ramathaim</em>
named Joseph, who was also himself a disciple of Jesus. (58) This man
went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded
it to be given up. (59) And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in <em class="Tillet">
pure linen</em>, (60) and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had <em class="HebMatt">
freshly</em>
 hewn out in the rock. And he rolled a great stone <em class="HebMatt">
over the entrance </em>
 of the tomb. (61) <em class="Tillet">
And there were present </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
Mary</em>
<em class="Tillet">
 the Magdalene and the other </em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
Marys</em>
<em class="Tillet">
 sitting over against the sepulcher.</em>
  (62) Now on the next day which was <em class="M&uuml;nster">
the day after the Preparation</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
of the Passover</em>, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together before
Pilate, (63) saying, &ldquo;Sir, we remember that this deceiver said
while he was yet alive, &lsquo;After three days <em class="Tillet">
of my death I will </em>
rise again <em class="HebMatt">
and come to life</em>.&rsquo; (64) Therefore, command that the sepulcher be made sure until
the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal him away,
and say to the people, &lsquo;He is risen from the dead.&rsquo; And the
last <em class="Tillet">
error</em>
 will be worse than the first.&rdquo; (65) Pilate said to them, &ldquo;<em class="HebMatt">Search out guards </em>
and <em class="GospHebrews">
make it as sure as you can.</em>&rdquo; (66) <em class="GospHebrews">
And he gave them armed men to sit right in front of the cave and guard it day and night.</em>
 So they went, and <em class="HebMatt">
completed the structure of the tomb</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
by</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
sealing the stone</em>, and <em class="Tillet">
making the sepulcher inaccessible </em>
by<em class="HebMatt">
 placing a guard there</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Eight</h2>

<p>(1) <em class="GreekVariants">
In </em>
the end of the second Sabbath that week, <em class="M&uuml;nster">
as the sun began to dawn </em>
<em class="Tillet">
toward</em>
<em class="M&uuml;nster">
 day one of the week</em>
 came Mary <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
of</em>
 <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
Magdala</em>
 and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.  (2) <em class="Tillet">
And behold</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 then the earth shook</em><em class="HebMatt-nccg">!</em>
 Then an angel of <em class="M&uuml;nster">
Yahweh</em>
  descended from heaven <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
to the tomb</em>, and came and rolled away the stone, <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
and stood up </em>
<em class="Tillet">
and sat upon it.</em>
 (3) His appearance was <em class="HebMatt">
like </em>
<em class="Tillet">
lightning</em>, and his raiment as snow.  (4) And for fear of him the <em class="HebMatt">
guards</em>
did quake, and became as dead men. (5) And the angel answered and said
to the women, &ldquo;Do not fear. For I know that you seek Jesus, who <em class="M&uuml;nster">
was crucified</em>. (6) He is not here. For he is <em class="HebMatt">
already alive</em>, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord <em class="HebMatt">
arose</em>. (7) And go quickly, and tell his disciples, that the<em class="HebMatt">
 Lord</em>
 is risen from the dead. And he is going before you <em class="Tillet">
into Galilee</em>. There you shall see him <em class="HebMatt">
as he told you</em>.&rdquo; (8) And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear <em class="HebMatt">
because they had seen the angel</em>, <em class="HebMatt">
but</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
with </em>
great joy <em class="HebMatt">
because the Lord had </em>
<em class="HebMatt-nccg">
risen</em>
<em class="HebMatt">
 to life. </em>
They<em class="HebMatt">
 </em>
ran to bring his disciples word. (9) <em class="HebMatt">
As they were going Jesus passed before them saying:</em>
 &ldquo;<em class="Tillet">Shalom be with you</em>. <em class="HebMatt">
May Yahweh deliver you</em>.&rdquo;  And they came <em class="HebMatt">
near</em>
 and <em class="HebMatt">
bowed down to him</em>
 <em class="Tillet">
and held him by the feet</em>. (10) Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Do not fear. Go tell my brothers
that they should depart for Galilee. There they shall see me.&rdquo;
(11) Now while they were going, some of the guard came into the city,
and told the chief priests all the things that <em class="HebMatt">
had happened</em>. (12) And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a great amount of money to the <em class="HebMatt">
horsemen</em>, (13) saying, &ldquo;Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while <em class="HebMatt">
you</em>
 slept. (14) And if this comes to the ears <em class="HebMatt">
of Pilate</em>, we will persuade him to<em class="HebMatt">
 leave you alone</em>, <em class="Tillet">
and </em>
thereby<em class="Tillet">
 protect you</em>.&rdquo; (15) So they took the money, and did as they were told. And this saying was <em class="Tillet">
common</em>
 among the Jews, and continues until this day. (16) But the  <em class="HebMatt">
twelve</em>
 disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had instructed them. (17) And when they saw him, they <em class="HebMatt-yaha">
bowed down before</em>
 him. But some doubted <em class="HebMatt">
him</em>. (17.1) <em class="GospHebrews">
I </em>
Matthew<em class="GospHebrews">
also truly saw him in the flesh after the resurrection, and believe
that he is. And, when he came to Peter and to those who were with</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
Peter, he said to</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
them: &ldquo;Take, feel me and see that I am not an incorporeal daemon.&rdquo; And immediately they touched him and believed.</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
He said to them: &ldquo;Why are you troubled, and thoughts ascend in
your hearts? See my hands and feet, that it is I myself. Handle and
discern, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that
I have.&rdquo; And, when he had said this, he showed them his hands and
feet. </em>
(17.2a) <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The disciples then asked: &ldquo;Are you the sacrifice that
appeases God&rsquo;s wrath for all time, or should sacrifices continue?
And Jesus replied</span>:<em class="GospHebrews">
 </em>
&ldquo;<em class="GospHebrews">Unless you cease from sacrificing, the wrath shall not cease from you</em>.&rdquo; (17.2b) <em class="Thomas">
The disciples said to Jesus: &ldquo;We know you will leave us. Who is
going to then lead us?&rdquo; Jesus said to them: &ldquo;No matter
where you reside, you are to go to James the Just, for whose sake
heaven and earth came into being.&rdquo; </em>
(17.3) <em class="GospHebrews">
And when the Lord had given his shroud to a servant of the priest he
went to James and appeared to him. For James had sworn that he would
not eat bread from that hour wherein he had drunk the cup of the Lord
until he saw him rising from the dead....</em>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Jesus said to James</span><em class="GospHebrews">, &ldquo;Bring a table and the bread.&rdquo; And </em><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">
Jesus</span><em class="GospHebrews">
 took up the bread and blessed </em><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">
God</span><em class="GospHebrews">
 and broke </em><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">
it</span><em class="GospHebrews">
 and afterwards gave it to James the Just and said to him, &ldquo;My brother, eat your</em>
 <em class="GospHebrews">
bread for the Son of Man is risen from them that sleep.&rdquo;</em>
(18) And Jesus came to the disciples and spoke to them, saying,
&ldquo;All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. (19)
Go<em class="HebMatt">
 to them</em>
 and <em class="Ebionite">
make disciples of all nations in my name</em>. (20.1) <em class="HebMatt-nccg">
And guard and</em>
 teach them to <em class="HebMatt">
carry out</em>
 <em class="HebMatt">
forever</em>
 all things whatever I commanded you. (20.2) <em class="Muslim">
Act as you have seen me act. Instruct people in accordance with
instructions I have given you. And be for them what I have been for you</em>. (20.3) <em class="M&uuml;nster">
And behold, I am with you until the consummation of the ages.</em>
&rdquo; (20.4) (Luke 24:50) <em class="Luke">
When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them</em>. (20.5)(Luke 24:51) <em class="Luke">
While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven</em>. (20.6)(Luke 24:52) <em class="Luke">
Then they having bowed before him returned to Jerusalem with great joy</em>. (20.7)(Luke 24:53) <em class="Luke">
And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God</em>.</p>
