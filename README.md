Backup and restoration of jesuswordsonly.com

Early in 2021 I noticed that the jesuswordsonly.com website was down. I found an archived copy from the Wayback Machine. The most recent archive from the Wayback Machine that has the page as it was for years is http://web.archive.org/web/20210122033624/https://jesuswordsonly.com/

Using a Ruby Gem (program), I retrieved this site in a restorative fashion (without Wayback Machine markings) using the following linux command:
```/home/a/.local/share/gem/ruby/2.7.0/bin/wayback_machine_downloader -t 20210122033624 https://jesuswordsonly.com/```
