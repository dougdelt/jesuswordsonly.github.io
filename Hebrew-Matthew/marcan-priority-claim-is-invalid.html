<h2>Marcan Priority Claim is Invalid</h2>

<h2>Matthean Priority: Unanimous Church Tradition</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">âAccording to church tradition, Mark wrote laterâ than Matthew or Luke. (Wilhel</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">m Martin L. de</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;"> Wette, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">An Historico-critical Introduction to the Canonical Books of the New Testament</span> (tr.F. Frothingham) (from the Lehrbuch, pt. 2) (1858) at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xkqDLGKjUvsC&amp;vq=According%20to%20church%20tradition%2C%20Mark%20wrote%20later&amp;pg=PA163#v=snippet&amp;q=According%20to%20church%20tradition,%20Mark%20wrote%20later&amp;f=false">163</a>.) Throughout this discussion, we will abbreviate this book citation as Wette.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette (12 January 1780 - 16 June 1849) was a German evangelical theologian and biblical scholar. His father was a pastor. Wette became professor of theology at Heidelberg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Wette in the <em>Historico-Critical Introduction</em> did an excellent job proving that Mark was dependent on both Luke and Matthew. Wette recreated systematically and simply how Mark took fragments from both Matthew and Luke. See Wette: 166-169.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">However, since Wetteâs effort, a different theory emergedâthat both Matthew and Luke were dependent upon Mark. If you read Wetteâs excellent points, however, this notion is inconceivable, as we shall revive below.</span></p>
<h2>Marcan Priority Claim</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Scholars today generally believe the Greek Mark came before the Greek Matthew. I will concede the point despite it being conjectural. However, these scholars do not factor into their thinking the importance that our Greek Matthew unquestionably derived from a Hebrew Matthew, and the Hebrew Matthew preceded the Greek Mark, as all early history records. In other words, the Hebrew Matthew is what predates both the Greek Mark and Greek Matthew. But theÂ consensus now is that Mark came before Matthewâyet scholars mean the Greek Matthew came after the Greek Mark. They do not take into serious account the fact there was a Hebrew Matthew before both of them. I call this error the Marcan priority claim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">The Marcan priority claim largely depends upon the simplistic argument that had Matthew in Greek pre-existed Markâs Gospel, then why did Mark not use the Sermon on the Mount? All other proofs are conjectural, as the notion of copying by Matthew of Mark can be stated with equal plausibility as Mark copying from Matthew. SeeÂ see Alan Barber, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/DID-JESUS-REALLY-THAT-ebook/dp/B0075Z8HG2">Did Jesus Really Say that? A Restoration of the First Gospel</a></em> (Kindle book, 2011).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">So letâs examine this issue of what explains why Mark would omit the Sermon on the Mount if Matthew which contains it actually came prior to Markâs Gospel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Assuming there was only a Greek Matthew, Baur long ago replied, and said that Mark did not wish to repeat the heart of the SermonâMatthew 5:17-20âwhich says the Law (Torah) was still to be upheld. As Wette relates: âBaur, p. 565, explains the omission of the Sermon on the Mount by its character as a statement of principles, and by the Evangelistâs caution in avoiding the dispute concerning the validity of the Mosaic Law.â (Wette: 174 fn. c.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Indeed, Mark never uses the word Law anywhere in his gospel. As we discuss below in more depth, Mark was identified in early church history as an associate of Paulâs. It is obvious he has a clearly pro-Paul bias in his Gospel. This explains why Mark omits the Sermon on the Mount with its repetitious emphasis on righteous behavior linked to membership in the kingdom, <em>e.g.</em>, peacemakers are called âsons of the kingdom,â merciful receive mercy, humble belong to the kingdom of heaven, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">But an equally valid explanation for Mark omitting the Sermon on the Mount is that if Matthew was first written in Hebrew (as all the evidence proves), and Mark could notÂ read Hebrew, as appears clearly to be the case from his poor use of Hebrew vocabulary, Mark would not be able to read the Gospel according to the Hebrews by Matthew (GATHM, for short) where the Sermon on the Mount first appeared. Mark then relied upon a sayings collection in Greek derived from the Hebrew Matthew, but like the sayings collection in the Gospel of Thomas from 100 AD, it lacked the Sermon on the Mount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Regardless of either explanationâs validity, we can agree in one sense with the Marcan priority claim. The Greek Mark could have preceded the Greek Matthew. Thus, the absence of the Sermon on the Mount in Mark is explained by either (a) Mark had a bias not to repeat what Matthew wrote in Hebrew or (b) Mark could not read Matthew in Hebrew but had access to a sayings collection in Greek which lacked the Sermon on the Mount. For example, the Gospel of Thomas is just such a Greek sayings-collection which lacks the Sermon on the Mount. Otherwise, it has many passages in common with Matthew that do not appear in Mark. Hence, either one of these reasonable possibilities (both consistent with the known history that Matthew came first) explains perfectly why the Sermon on the Mount is absent in Markâs Gospel. The most likely explanation is indeed (a), as we discuss next.</span></p>
<h2>Pro-Paul Bias Explains Mark Edited Matthew</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">So is it demonstrable that Mark had a pro-Paul bias as Bauer claimed?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">John Mark was a companion of Paul referenced in Colossians 4:10 and Philemon 24. The Coptic churchâthe most ancient Christian Church of Egyptâmaintains this same John Mark was the author of Markâs Gospel. SeeÂ â<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_the_Evangelist">Mark the Evangelist</a>,â Wikipedia (2011).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">But was Mark instead close to Peter and written under Peterâs influence, as is commonly asserted? Not if you listen to the earliest source on the origin of Markâs Gospel: Clement. Eusebius quoted Clement, an early leader at Rome about </span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">92 AD, who said Peter was unaware Mark had written a gospel until it was completed, âand that when the matter came to Peterâs knowledge, he neither strongly forbad it nor urged it forward.âÂ Eusebius <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> 6.14.6-10, cited in Powell, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Robbing Peter to Pay Paul, supra</span>, at 71.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">The notion that Peter gave Mark his Gospel originated almost 100 years later and much farther from Rome where Mark wrote. It came from Egyptâs Origen (ca. 185 AD). But that means that it âappears the farther from Peterâs lifetime we get, the closer Mark is to him [i.e., Peter].âÂ Powell,Â <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Robbing Peter to Pay Paul</span>, supra, at 71.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Conversely, when we move closer to Peterâs lifetime, there is absolutely no link between Markâs Gospel and Peter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Hence, as a matter of history, there is more reason to support a Pauline connection than a Petrine connection to the origin of Markâs Gospel. And this will help us identify the likely reason that Mark omitted the Sermon on the Mount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Why does a connection between Mark and Paul best explain the absence of the Sermon on the Mount rather than that Mark was written before Matthew, and thus Matthew added the Sermon for his own reasons?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">As explained by scholar David C. Sim from the Department of New Testament Studies University of Pretoriain in his article âMatthewâs anti-Paulinism: A neglected feature of Matthean studies,â <span style="text-decoration: underline;">HTS</span> 58(2) 2002 at 776-777 [<a href="http://www.hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/download/557/456">PDF link</a>]:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">H D Betz...argued that the Sermon on the Mount...reflected a conservative Jewish Christian perspective that was overtly anti-Pauline (cf Mt 5:17-20; 7:13-27.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">How so? The Sermon on the Mount emphasized the Law and obedience for kingdom entry. For Matthew 5:20 said âyour righteousness must exceed that of the Phariseesâ whoÂ Jesus in Matthew depicts as anti-legalists / shallow adherents to the Law. See Matt 15:6, 23:23. See also âMatthew 23:23: Pharisees As Anti-Legalistsâ on page 178 infra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">To confirm this, do we find a consistent bias in Mark which similarly explains why other passages in Matthew do not appear?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Indeed, there are numerous examples that Mark removes verses which have an anti-Paul flavor but which permeate Matthewâs Gospel, whether GATHM or the Greek version, including the Sermon on the Mount (viz., Matt 5:19).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">For example, in Mark, gone is the reference in Matthew 5:17-19 that the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens teaches the Law, but the one loosening the Law will be known as the LEASTâthe meaning of Paulâs Latin name of Paulus, a contraction of Pauxillus which means the LEAST. (See âMatthew 5:19: A Reference To Paul?â on page 158 infra.) In fact, the word Law never appears in Mark!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">In Mark, gone is the reference to the false prophets as âravening wolvesâ in âsheepâs clothingâ as we find in Matthew 7:15âan obvious allusion to the âBenjamite Ravening Wolfâ prophecy of Genesis 49:27 which was hardly complimentary of Paul. (See âMatthew 7:15: The Benjamite Wolf Prophecyâ on page 160 infra.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Gone also in Markâs account of the Parable of the Wheat and the Tares (Mark 4:26-29 cfr. Matthew 13:24-29; 36-40) wherein the Tares are first taken from the earth when Christ returns, not Christians. Thus, Mark removes the fact that Matthewâs account of the same parable is at odds with Paul in 1 Thess. 4:17. There Paul says instead that Christians are raptured first, leaving the evil behind. Markâs Gospel tells the same parable by Jesus but without the fact the evil are raptured, not Christians, when Christ returns. Mark similarlyÂ omits Matthew 24:31 which repeats that the evil are first raptured out of the earth, leaving the righteous to inherit the earth (which matches Revelation ch. 14 as well). See Matthew 24:31.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Also disappearing from the Parable of the Wheat and the Tares is the allusion to an âenemyâ sowing tares among wheat. As several commentators point out, the Parable of the Tares in Matthew was apparently intended as direction to orthodox Christians to tolerate Paulâs followers in the church as sown by an âenemy.â Even though this message was kind and tolerant, Mark, with a pro-Paul bias, evidently would not want it to appear Jesus was giving any prophetic attention to the problem of Paul. Especially if Jesus depicted Paul as an enemy. This would explain again why Mark dropped âenemyâ out of the parable. See Matthew 13:25, 39</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Gone also in Markâs account is Peterâs confession of Jesus as âMessiah, Son of God.â (Matt 16:17.) As a result, gone is that Jesus says Heaven revealed this to Peter, implying Peter received this directly from the Father. Cfr. Mark 8:29. And Matthew adds that Jesus says that upon this rock (Peterâs faith? or Peter whose name means rock?), Jesus will found His church.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">David C Sim in his article, âMatthewâs anti-Paulinism: A neglected feature of Matthean studies,â HTS 58(2) (2002) [<a href="http://www.hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/download/557/456">PDF link</a>] explains the anti-Pauline feature to this passage of Matthew:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">â[T]he words of Jesus in Mt 16:17 bear a striking similarity to Paulâs words of his own revelation and commission by the risen Christ in Gl 1:12 and 16-17. Matthew [sic: Jesus] is making the point that it was Peter and not Paul who experienced divine revelations and who was commissioned by Jesus to lead the church.â See also, Sim, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Gospel of Matthew and Christian Judaism: The history and social setting of the Matthean community</span> (Edinburgh: T&amp; T Clark, 1998) at 200-203.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Why would Mark leave out something that elevates Peter? Because a defender of Paul would wish to take such recognition from Peter, as Paul attacked Peter in Galatians as a hypocrite (Gal. 2:11-12), dismissing him as a âseemingâ pillar of the church (Gal. 2:9) who âimparted nothing to meâ (Gal 2:7) and âwhatsoever they [i.e., Peter, James and John] were makes no difference to me,â i.e., Paul is unimpressed by their stature with Jesus. Gal 2:6. Markâs Gospel by deleting these passages supportive of Peter in Matthew would present a gospel easier for Paulâs followers to read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Gone in Mark is also Jesusâ statement to call no man âfatherâ in Matt 23:9, when Paul told the Corinthians he was their âspiritual fatherâ in Christ. See âMatthew 23:9: Donât Call Anyone Fatherâ on page 177 infra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;"><span> </span>Also gone in Mark is Matthew 23:21 where Jesus says not to swear by the Temple where âGod residesâ when Paul teaches at Athens that God âdoes not live in temples built by human hands.â (Acts 17:24.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Gone in Mark is also Jesusâ depiction of the Pharisees as anti-legalists in Matthew 23:23 whom Jesus faults for obeying the smaller parts of the Law but not teaching the greater parts of the Law, i.e., justice, piety and mercy. Of course, Paul had the view the Pharisees were strict legalists. He states this in Philippians 3:5-6 and Acts 26:5. See âMatthew 23:23: Pharisees As Anti-Legalistsâ on page 178 et seq.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">In addition, gone in Mark is the reference that Jesus says the Pharisees were excellent at performing the outward acts necessary to appear in compliance with the Law, but inwardly were deceitful and corrupt. (Matt 23:28.) Jesus in Matthew similarly says the Pharisees were white-washed tombs on the outside to make others believe they were law-abiding. They cleaned the outside of the cup when their external behavior was solely to appear Law-compliantâan expedient to gain honors and money; it was not to truly obey God. (Matt 23:25, 27.) But Paul openly endorsed and practiced exactly the same outward-Law-conformance practices, acknowledging inwardly he was not subject to the Law but obeyed the Law solely for expedience-sake to gain adherents among Jews. (1 Cor 9:20-21 (âto the Jews I became as a Jew that I might win Jews...myself not being myself under the Law....â) Paul even extolled hypocrisy for the sake of gaining followers: âBut be it so, I did not myself burden you; but,Â being crafty, I caught you with guile.â (2 Cor. 12:16, ASV.) Mark deleted all condemnations by Jesus of the Phariseesâ tactic of hypocritical obedience to the Law to gain adherents.Â Any follower of Paul aware of such passages must cringe when reading Matthew. But such problem is absent with Mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">There is no doubt about Paulâs principles that are implicated by our Lordâs words. For example, Paul taught that he was free to violate the Exodus command not to eat meat sacrificed to idols, but Paul said that only if he were around someone who thought it was wrong, Paul would refrain from eating such meat. (1 Cor 8:11.) Paulâs moral explanation for such behavior appears to be what Jesus condemnedâobedience solely for expediency but otherwise Paul thought he did not have to obey any inward duties imposed by the Law. Paul wrote: âAll things are lawful but not all things are necessarily expedient.â (1 Cor 6:12.) Paul also explained that on eating such foods, the rule was not to offend by insisting upon any principles so as to gain adherents: âTherefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do...[g]ive no offense, either to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God, just as I also please all men in all things,...seeking...the profit of many, that they may be saved.â (1Corinthians 10:31-33.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">So in Markâs Gospel, we find Jesusâs words are erased which condemn similar hypocrisy of the Pharisees whom Jesus said obeyed the Law for appearance-sake and expediency to gain followers. Thus, Markâs gospel served to cleanse such embarrassing commands from our Saviorâthereby becoming an important text to use if one were to have a gospel acceptable to Paulâs followers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Likewise, gone in Mark is the command âdo not take wagesâ (OGM) and âfreely you received, freely giveâ (ASV) which we find in Matthew 10:8. These Matthean lessons were similarly at odds with Paul who tells the Corinthians: âI robbed other churches, taking wages of them that I might minister unto you.â 2 Cor 11:8 (ASV.) Paul defended preachers taking wages of the churches in 1 Tim. 5:17, where Paul wrote: âThe elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor [i.e., payment] especially thoseÂ whose work is preaching and teaching.â Paul defends this by using a verse about not muzzling an ox, applying that agricultural rule to imply churchgoers have a duty to pay the elders for their service. (1 Tim. 5:18.) Hence, Jesusâ blunt lesson not to take wages for preaching again was evidently removed by Mark as Mark apparently did with so many other passages where Jesusâ words otherwise trouble a follower of Paul.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Sermon On The Mount: Why Remove It?</span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">We mentioned briefly above why in Mark the Sermon on the Mount would be difficult to explain by a Paul-advocate. The Sermon is not omitted in Mark because Matthew came second, as is typically claimed today. Rather, Matthew first wrote the Sermon, as all historical accounts of the sequence of writing were recorded. Consistent with all the foregoing examples of passages Mark removed, the Sermon on the Mount reflects salvation principles which a follower of Paul would disagree with. Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount promises mercy to the merciful, the kingdom of heaven to the peacemakers, âentry into heavenâ to those whose conduct exceeds the righteousness of the PhariseesâMatthew 5:20âwho are depicted as shallow-followers of the Law by Jesus in Matthew 23:23, etc. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus repetitiously links behaviors to salvation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">By contrast, Paul in Romans 4:4-5 says God justifies the âungodlyâ based on faith alone, to the one who âworketh not.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Another example of where Jesus elevates behaviors as a necessary component of salvation in the Sermon on the Mount is when Jesus spoke of the necessity to exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees to be saved. (Matt. 5:20.) Jesus meant the Pharisees were shallow adherents to the Law, as He explained in Matt 23:23. Thus, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus clearly says that âunless your righteousness exceeds that of the Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.â (Matt 5:20.) But Paul clearly taught that seeking to be righteous by more than mere faith such as by obeying the LawÂ could actually sever you from Christ. Supposedly, now you sought to please God by adding obedience to the Law rather than simply relying upon just having faith, and this attitude alone allegedly severs you from Christ. (Gal. 5:4.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Many defenders of Paul acknowledge the Sermon on the Mount repeatedly contradicts Paul. They offer up the Dispensational solution to avoid the importance of the contradictions. For example, Clarence Larkin was the founder of this dispensational theology in his work <a href="http://www.preservedwords.com/disptruth/title.htm">Dispensational Truth</a> (Philadelphia: Larkin, 1918). Larkin claims Paul came with a superseding gospel to that found in Matthew through John. Thus, Larkin freely acknowledged Paul contradicts Christâs message in the Sermon on the Mount. But Larkinâs Dispensationalism theory explains this away, claiming that Jesus was talking to Jews under an old covenant while Paul was talking to all in the new covenant. And thus Larkin teaches Jesusâ teachings in the Sermon on the Mount âhave no application to the Christian, but only to those who are under the Law, and therefore must apply to another Dispensation than this.â (<em>Id</em>., at 87.) Thus, Larkin teaches that we are free to stay in Paulâs Gospel despite a contrary lesson from Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">This underscores why Mark took the path he did. Mark did not know of such a dispensational theory to explain away Jesusâ words. Thus, Mark had to find a different resolution. Mark simply erased what Pauline scholars today acknowledge are contradictions between Paul and Jesus. Hence, Mark drops Matthew 5:17âthe greatest teach the Law, and the least do notâwith all the Sermonâs illustrations by simply eliminating the Sermon altogether. Â Confirming that the Sermon on the Mount is the thorn Mark deliberately removed is a lesson from Pastor Mike Paulson at Touchet Bible Church. He put it bluntly that we must only follow Paulâs Gospel and disregard that belonging to Jesus from the Sermon on the Mount as a supposedly superseded Gospel, saying:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">The stuff in the Sermon on the Mount actually contradicts Paulâs teachings in everything from salvation to doctrinal belief! You would think folks would see thisâbut like Jesus said of them, ye err not knowing the Scriptures....Pastor Mike Paulson, WWJD v. WWPD? and is reprinted at http://www.touchet1611.org/ (accessed 2005).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Thus, Bauer who first noted this as Markâs likely motivation was correct. Mark knew the Sermon on the Mount would make followers of Paul feel very uncomfortable. Paul was Markâs mentor and companion. âGet Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry.â (2 Tim. 4:11.) Thus, Mark helped Paulâs ministry by redacting from the gospel passages like the Sermon on the Mount which would cause tension for a defender of Paul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">And further confirming this as true is that Markâs Gospel borrows from Luke, but also omits any passages in Luke that are at apparent odds with doctrines of Paul. As Ernst von Bunsenâone who holds Paul has the superseding Gospel to that of Matthew, concluded: âThroughout this Gospel [of Mark] we have traced an evident design to place Paul on par with the other apostles, by harmonizing the principal differences between Matthewâs and Lukeâs gospels.â (Ernst von Bunsen, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Hidden Wisdom of Christ and the Key of Knowledge</span> (Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, &amp; Green, 1865) Vol. 2 at 295.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Luke, whom most assume would edit to serve Paulâs interest, does not do so. He actually repeats many of the passages in Matthew at odds with Paulâs doctrine. Thus, Bunsen goes on, noting Markâs Gospel deliberately left out those parts of âLukeâs Gospel in which the public doctrine and its apostolic promulgators are too unfavorably contrasted with the more perfect, because more complete, Hidden Wisdom of Christ, as first openly proclaimed by Paul.â So Mark even edits down Luke to omit any principles which might cause difficulty in accepting Paul.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Markâs Pattern To Bolster Paulâs Doctrines</span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Hence, the omission of the Sermon on the Mount of Matthew fits a clear pattern in Mark to promote a gospel that Paulâs followers could read without any tension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">At the same time, Markâs Gospel repeatedly contains Paulâs theory of the emptying (kenosis) of Christ of any presence of deity (Phil. 2:6-7). Paul taught Christ âcounted equality with Godâ as not something to hold onto, and instead âemptied himselfâ (kenosis) and came to earth in the appearance of a man. Thus, even though Jesus in Matthew always knows what people are thinking and is not excluded from the Fatherâs counsel (e.g., Matt 26:10 OGM âJesus who knows everything in regard to any matter doneâ), in Markâs Gospel, we find the opposite. Markâs Gospel repeatedly insists upon Jesusâ ignorance or inability to do things in the same context where Matthew lacks any such statements. For example, Mark, not Matthew, says the Father but ânot the Sonâ knows when the end will come. See Footnote 431 in OGM Vol. I on page 187. See also âMatthew 24:36: âNeither The Sonâ Is Inauthenticâ on page 197 et seq.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Charles Powell provides a list from Mark of these kenotic statements (i.e., where Jesus is described by Mark as emptied of divine knowledge) with this explanation:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Texts in Mark, but not in Matthew where Jesus expresses ignorance or inability include Mark 1:45; 5:9, 30; 6:5, 38, 48; 7:24; 8:12, 23; 9:16, 21, 33; 11:13; 14:14. However, none of these statements in Mark appear in the manuscripts of Matthew surveyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">These kenosis-edits by Mark had a benefit to a Paul confidant as John Mark. Not only did they support the kenotic claims by Paul about Jesus that He âemptied Himselfâ of what made Him equal to God, but they significantly increased the importance of Paul. For the way Mark wrote his gospel, Jesus was ignorant of the Fatherâs truths while in the flesh, e.g., when the Son of Man would return. The consequenceÂ was, as pro-Paul advocate Marcion claimed in 144 AD, that the only âJesusâ who was in true contact with the Father was the Jesus who had ascended. It is this Jesus who then came to earth in the wilderness near Damascus to reveal Himself to Paul alone, supposedly giving Paul therefore the superior revelation. See Dr. Peter M. Head (New Testament Research Fellow, Tyndale House), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The History of the Interpretation of the Apostle Paul</span> (2001).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">The influential theologian Rudolf Bultmann claimed Paul actually taught this in 2 Cor. 5:16. There Paul says that âeven though we once knew Christ by means of the flesh [kata sarka], we know him thus no longer.â Bultmann explained Paul meant that we once knew Jesus in the flesh before the Ascensionâwhen Jesus had experienced kenosisââemptied himselfââof any aspects of Deity / equality with God. These âfleshâ experiences with Jesus are, in Bultmannâs reading of Paulâs 2 Cor. 5:16, the gospel accounts of Jesusâ pre-ascension life such as contained in Matthew. In that time, Jesus was supposedly ignorant of Godâs true will due to kenosis. But once Jesusâ ascended, Paul meant we know Jesus only in the way God revealed Christ in Paul where Jesus then supposedly knew the true will of God-the-Father. Paul then became the divine conduit of this very different Christ. As proof this was Paulâs view, in Galatians 1:15-16 Paul said: âBut when it pleased him who had set me apart from my motherâs womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me....â Also, the fact Paul never quotes Jesus from the gospels (except for the liturgy of communion) makes Bultmannâs interpretation of Paulâs meaning quite plausible. (110) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Footnote 110: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">The quandary of Paul is always how can we understand his persistent non-mention about Jesusâs life or words from the gospels. Bultmann says this proves Paul adamantly refused to know Jesus that way, bolstering his reading of 2 Cor. 5:16. The quandary is well-explained by Hermann Detering, a Berlin pastor, in <em>The Falsified Paul</em> (1995) (reprinted by Institute for Higher Critical Studies, 2003) at 10: âCan one imagine that someone who had just experienced the decisive turning-point of his life through a revelation took no notice and had no interest in the earthly past of the one who stood in the center of this revelation? In any case, I myself was not able to replicate the tenacious ignorance with which Paul dealt with the history of Jesus.â Bultmann takes this same point, and says when Paul claims he received his revelation directly from the Jesus (Gal. 1:16-17) on that road to Damascus, and the twelve âimparted nothing to meâ (Gal. 2:6), this means Paul is telling us we need not know Jesus through the written gospels but only listen to the Christ revealed âin meâ as Paul put it. (Gal. 1:16.) Â [End FN]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">This kenosis doctrine repeated in Markâs Gospel thus transforms Paul into the only apostle to whom we must listen to post-ascension. As explained in Paul Barnett, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paul: Missionary of Jesus</span> (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2008) at 13:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Bultmann...regards the historical Jesus as irrelevant as to the kerygma [<em>i.e.</em>, preaching] of the risen Lord whom Paul proclaimed. Bultmann understood 2 Corinthians 5:16 (âeven though we once knew ChristÂ kata sarka [through/by means of the flesh], we know him thus no longerâ) to mean that Paul chose not to employ his knowledge of Jesus kerygmatically, a view with which Bultmann agreed [with Paul]. Accordingly, the influential scholar of Marburg [<em>i.e</em>., Bultmann] declared Paul the âfounder of Christian theology.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">And this is how Marcion in 144 AD made the similar claim that only Paul was the apostle of Jesusâ Christâthe one who ascended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">There are many other reasons to see Mark as a rewrite of a Greek translation source that contained select sayings from Matthew. As Martin de Wette said:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">If the parallel passages, especially those in Matthew, be compared with it, the Gospel of Mark shows unmistakable signs of non-originality, both in the representation of the teachings of Jesus, which are given sometimes in wrong connections, sometimes more or less disfigured, and in the historic accounts, which are sometimes arbitrarily altered, sometimes amplified by more or less suspicious additions. (Wilhelm Martin L. de Wette, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">An Historico-critical Introduction to the Canonical Books of the New Testament</span> (tr.F. Frothingham) (from the Lehrbuch, pt. 2] (1858) at 164.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Wette then gives very detailed proofs of each of these statements in his footnotes. For example, Mark 7:6 has the wrong sequence, demonstrable when you see the correct sequence in Matthew 15:3 ff. The prayer of Mark 14:36, compared to Matthew 26:39,42 is âmanifestly distorted.â Mark 10:12 is âinconsistent with the Jewish system of divorce.â (Wette: 164 fn. b.) Mark 7:24 has a âmistaken reason given for Jesusâ mode of proceedingâ while âthe true oneâ in Matt 15:24 is âbeing omitted.â (Wette: 164 fn. c.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Mark has made an âunthinking repetitionâ in Mark 6:14 and 6:16 which evidently was caused by copying from both Matthew and Luke simultaneously. (Wette: 165 fn. c.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Like the Pauline corpus, Markâs âselections from the gospel matters...show comparatively little interest in the teachings of Jesus.â (Wette: 163.) Like Paulâs emphasis on historical facts about Jesus as the only âgospel,â Markâs ânotion of the âGospel,â placed at the beginning and elsewhere introduced (1:45; 8:35; 10:29)...denot[es] the...historic facts concerning the manifestation of the Son of God (1:1)....â (Wette: 163). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Wette concludes Mark simply took âfragmentsâ from both Matthew and Luke, and âsubordinated the doctrinal element of the Gospel to the miraculous, and avoided long discourses....â (Wette: 166.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Mark also leans toward docetism, that is, Jesus supposedly only appeared to have human flesh. For example, Schwegler points out that there is no birth narrative at all, which points to docetism, <em>i.e.</em>, Jesus was not a true human being. (Wette:174.) Likewise, Paul endorses docetism in Romans 8:3 (âGod sent His own Son in the likeness of sinful human fleshâ) and Phil 2:7 (âappeared to be a manâ). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">In fact, Marcionâthe docetic heretic of 144 ADâcopied Markâs silence on any birth of Christ: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">We have pointed out the striking similarity between the beginning of Marcionâs gospel and that after Mark; also the hidden reference in the latter to the spread of heresy; and the Docetic development of theÂ doctrine about the person of Jesus, as traceable in the Gospels, among which that after Mark represents the nearest approach to the Docetic denial of Christâs humanity. (Bunsen: 294.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Hence, Mark came after the original (Hebrew) Matthew, as church tradition always said.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Conclusion</span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Accordingly, we can trust that the Hebrew Matthew came first, as all the earliest church leaders always affirmed. The alleged modern proof that Mark came first principally rests upon the fact the Sermon on the Mount is missing in Mark. Supposedly Matthew added it rather than Mark omitted it. However, there are far stronger reasons to believe Mark omitted it rather than believe Matthew added it. These reasons thus confirm the unanimous historical accounts that the Hebrew Matthew came before Mark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">And one reason Mark omitted it is simple. This explanation does not even involve bias. Simply, Mark relied upon a sayings gospel in Greek that was similar to the Gospel of Thomas which also omits the Sermon on the Mount. Mark was a Gentile who did not read Hebrew. Thus he could not read the Hebrew Matthew. He was relegated to a sayings gospel in Greek which simply was snippet quotes from Matthew. Hence, Mark omitted the Sermon simply because he could not reliably read the original Matthew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Second, and the evidence is compelling for this explanation, the explanation is because Mark was a confidant of Paul. Markâs Gospel is clearly a systemic edit to remove any aspect of Jesusâ teachings that differs from Paul. Markâs Gospel not coincidentally confirms the kenosis doctrine of Paul that Jesus emptied himself of any aspect of divine indwelling when He was on earth. (Cfr. John 14:7-10, Jesus says Father dwells in Him.) By contrast, in Matthew this divine indwelling happens at Jesusâ baptism when the dove enters Jesus.</span></p>
