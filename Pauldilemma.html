<big><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Dilemma Paul Poses</span></big><br>



<br>



Have you ever struggled to reconcile the words of Paul to the
words of Jesus?<br>



<br>



Does Jesus' message that the publican who confesses his sin goes home
justified cause you conflict when reading Paul's words? Jesus says the
one who thinks he is already one of the elect and thus does not repent
from sin goes home unjustified. However, Paul is understood to teach
that repentance from sin is a work, and cannot be tied to
justification. Salvation is not of works (Eph. 2:8-9; Romans 4:4).
Repentance at most deals with sanctification, so Paul is understood to
say. <br>



<br>



Thus, Jesus' message that repentance is tied to justification (not
sanctification) is ignored. Paul is used to negate Jesus' words. <br>



<br>



Or what about Jesus' message that among those sent to hell are ones
whom Jesus calls goats in the parable of the sheep and the goats. (Matt. 25:31 <span style="font-style: italic;">et seq.)</span> The
goats called Jesus Lord but did not clothe the naked and feed the poor.
Jesus says they go to
hell. But Paul says that if you confess Jesus is Lord and believe Jesus
rose from the dead, you shall be saved. (Romans 10:9.) <br>



<br>



Thus, Jesus is
adding <span style="font-style: italic;">works </span>to the
salvation formula. In fact, the works that Jesus insists upon are
identical to what James 2:14-17 says is necessary for salvation. James
says
if you fail to clothe the naked, feed the hungry, etc., "Can such faith
save
you?" It is a rhetorical question. It calls for a negative answer. No,
you are not saved if you fail to clothe the naked and feed the poor.
James' point is the same as Jesus' point in the parable of the sheep
and the goats. <br>



<br>



However, Paul would call Jesus and James heretics because they clearly
add works to the salvation formula.<br>



<br>



Does this trouble you as it does me?<br>



<br>



Then my book <span style="font-style: italic;">Jesus' Words Only&nbsp;</span>should help you resolve the conflict.<br>
