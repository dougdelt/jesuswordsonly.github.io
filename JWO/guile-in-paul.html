<h2>Guile in Paul</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">A good introductory point to this topic is Proverbs <a href="http://ebible.com/bible/Proverbs%2012:10">12:10</a> (NIV) which says "theÂ <span class="smallCaps">LORD</span> condemns <strong>a crafty man</strong>." We read similarly in Psalm 5:6: "Â <em><strong>deceitful</strong></em> men the LORD abhors." And finally,Â â<span><strong>Cursed is he who doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully.â </strong>Jeremiah 48:10<span>. Cf. Rev. 14:5: "</span></span><span>And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God."</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">What kind of teacher was Paul, by his own admission? Did Paul ever say he used deceit (guile) and used craftiness to capture disciples? We shall see.</span></p>
<h3>Jesus' Example We Were To Follow</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">In Jesus was "no guile."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Jesus âleft us an example, that we should follow His steps: who did no sin, neither was<strong><em> guile</em></strong> found in His mouth.â (1 Peter<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:21-22&amp;version=ASV"> 2:21-22</a>)(ASV.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">What if Jesus ever spoke the words "I was crafty, and captured you with guile (deception)"? Wouldn't we think then Jesus was a sinner, and could not be of God? Wouldn't we conclude that if Jesus had truly said such a thing that Jesus would be cursed by God pursuant to Jeremiah 48:10? We would be compelled to abandon Jesus if he ever made such an outrageous statement that "I was crafty and captured you with guile / deception."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">But then Paul says the same thing in 2 Cor. 12:16 which we would be revulsed if Jesus had said it, but we just accept it from Paul:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being <strong><em>crafty</em></strong>, I <em><strong>caught you with guile</strong></em>. (2 Cor. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20corinthians%2012:16&amp;version=ASV">12:16</a>, ASV.)</span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Paul elsewhere speaks of lies being a means of spreading the gospel: âWhat then? Only that in every way, <strong>whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.â </strong>Philippians 1:18. A similar cavalier attitude toward lying for the gospel is found here: â<strong>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; </strong>why yet am I also judged as a sinner?âÂ Romans 3:7</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">How instead should a follower of Jesus interpret Paul's statement in 2 Cor. 12:16 -- "being crafty, I caught you with guile"? We will prove this means we need to eject Paul from our minds and Bibles as an authority as his presence destroys the integrity of Scripture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">To prove this, we will demonstrate how <em><strong>Paulinists defend Paul's use of guile</strong></em>, and their explanation why Paul intentionally uses double-speak. Paul's agenda was, they claim, to get faith alone sold to the masses, and displace the gospel given by the 12--a defunct gospel these Paulinists assert. To do this, Paul had to use guile, but this goal supposedly justifies the means. This rationale has a familiar ring? <strong><em>The end supposedly justifies the means. </em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">However, the Christ-centered response is that it is destructive of our Savior's message to keep such a voice alongside our Savior. If we rationalize Paul can legitimately deceive us, and this is accepted<strong><em> to justify accepting a different Gospel than Jesus truly preached</em></strong>, then we will be permitting Paul's guileful tactic to <strong><em>rationalize destruction of the path to righteousness</em></strong>---the WAY Jesus taught. No man comes to the Father but by Jesus and His Principles. To let Paul draw us from the Way is to listen to a different voice than our Savior's.</span></p>
<h2>Paul Defends The Use of Guile To Gain Followers</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Paul admits he was often being deceptive. Paul distinctly says, âbeing<strong><em> crafty, I caught you with guile</em></strong>â (2 Cor. 12:16.) In Greek, it means Paul used an âartificeâ by seeming to be other than what he was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Jesus spoke in condemnation of such tactics by men He called "Hypocrites!" These men were the Pharisees. Then consider Paul counted himself still a member after becoming a Christian:Â "My brothers, <em><strong>I am a Pharisee</strong></em>, the son of a Pharisee..." Acts <a href="http://bible.cc/acts/23-6.htm">23:6</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">A Greek commentary on 2 Cor. 12:16 explains and defends Paul as meaning:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">âI ensnared you by <em><strong>an artifice...</strong></em>in order to make you <em><strong>my prey</strong></em> by means of others my emissaries.â (C. Wordsworth, <em>The New Testament of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the Original Greek; with notes by C. Wordsworth, Canon of Westminster</em> (London: 1859) at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JeIPAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=wordsworth%20artifice%20semblance&amp;pg=PA179#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">179</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Yuck!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Paulâs self-professed guile compounds itself when he tells the Thessalonians to the contrary: âFor our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, <em><strong>nor in guile</strong></em>.â (1 Thess. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20thess.%202:3&amp;version=ASV">2:3</a>.) Which way is it Paul? Honesty or guile? You cannot even decide! Are you thruthful here, or merely more guile?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">As a result, Paulinists delight and exalt in Paul being duplicitous, fully admitting he quotes Bible passages out of context, speaks contradictorily, and misleads the reader to think he endorses the Law, repentance and obedience for salvation so as to deflect the criticism from the 12. But all the while these Paulinists admit Paul is merely opening the door for a different gospel, and that is his real agenda. Paulâs record of all such crafty arguments is admiringly reviewed and defended in a book by the evangelical Mark D. Given entitled <em>Paulâs True Rhetoric: Ambiguity, Cunning, and Deception in Greece and Rome</em> (Harrisburg, PA: Trinity Press International, 2002)</span></p>
<h2>Praise Of Paul's Use of Guile to Win Followers</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Givenâs book is even highly praised in mainstream Biblical journals. For example, seeÂ the favorable review in Samuel Byrskog, âPaulâs True Rhetoric: Ambiguity, Cunning, and Deception in Greece and Rome,â <em>Journal of Biblical Literature</em> (December 31, 2002).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">This characteristic in Paul has a long history of recognition and praise by both Erasmus (1466-1536) of Holland and by Luther.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Erasmus was the first European reformer in the early 1500s. He recognized Paulâs use of cunning and deception. Erasmus said in glowing terms that Paul in Romans uses â<strong><em>pious cunning</em></strong> and holy flattery.â Erasmus elsewhere similarly says: âThis apostle of ours is<strong><em> always skillful and slippery...such a squid, such a chameleon</em></strong> â he plays the part of Proteus or Vertumnus.â This quote is found inÂ <em>Holy Scripture Speaks: The Production and Reception of Erasmusâ Paraphrases of the New Testament</em> (ed. Hilmar M. Pabel &amp; Mark Vessey) (University of Toronto Press, 2002) at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6nVE1e1O7-kC&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=skillful%20slippery%20squid%20cameleon&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">105</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">FYI: âErasmus, the greatest scholar of that age, had at first sympathized with Luther...[b]ut when Erasmus perceived that Lutherâs teachings, instead of reforming, produced confusion, disorder and threatened to undermine society itselfâ he backed off. (Stang, <em>The Life of Martin Luther</em> (Pustet, 1883) at 53.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">One would imagine that if Paul used deception it would prove embarrassing to those who admired Paul. Yet, Mr. Given finds Paulâs guile as something <strong><em>praiseworthy</em></strong>. Paul was presenting a âmysterious...and finally <strong><em>sophistic</em></strong> God who<strong><em> cares enough to be cunning and is devoted enough to be deceptive</em></strong>.â (Given, <em>Paul's True Rhetoric</em> (2002), <em>supra</em> at 181.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Double-Yuck!</span></p>
<h2>Paul's Self-Avowed Hypocritical Tactics To Gain Followers</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">While Paul himself condemned Peter for accommodating Gentiles when he was around Gentiles and acting like a Jew around Jews, here is what Paul claimed to do, and commanded the Corinthians to do as well.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">"For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more; and <strong><em>to the Jews I became as a Jew</em></strong>, that I might win Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might win those who are under the law;<em><strong> to those who are without the law as without law... that I might win those who are without law</strong></em>; to the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some." 1Corinthians 9:19-22</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">"Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. Give no offense, either to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God, just as<strong><em> I also please all men in all things</em></strong>, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved. Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ." 1Corinthians 10:31-33</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Again, can anyone imagine Jesus / Yahshua playing chameleon and saying anything like "I have become all things to all men" or "I please all men in all things" as does Paul? But clearly this was Paul's tactical use of guile to gain followers -- deceiving Jews by keeping the outside of the cup clean by obeying Jewish laws and deceiving Gentles by appearing to countenance their behaviors when around them as well.</span></p>
<h2>Luther Defends Paul's Use of Deception To Win Faith Alone Argument</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Sadly, Paul was used by Luther in the early stages of the German Reformation to justify hypocritical tactics to promote the 'gospel' of Paul. Luther recognized that Paul advanced his faith-alone gospel by means of what were kindly dubbed pious frauds. Paul would often affirm the opposite of salvation by faith alone, matching Jesusâ salvation formula. Yet, Paulâs ulterior goal (and hence allegedly his supposedly laudable goal) was cunningly to slip in the teaching of salvation by faith alone as the superior message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">In other words, you find the early German reformers admitted Paul used guile when Paul repeated Jesusâ message of faith and works. They said Paul advanced Jesusâ message of salvation by works and obedience only as a tactic to <strong><em>disarm the twelve apostles and James</em></strong> (the Lordâs brother) who suspected Paul was, in fact, retreating from Christâs doctrine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Luther recognized several passages showed Paul was working against the apostolic twelve. Paul often intimates the twelve apostles and James â the bishop whom the twelve appointed over Jerusalem â were the opponents of Paul's gospel. See Gal. 2:6 (apostles âimparted nothing to meâ); Gal. 2:9 (referring to Peter, John and James, Paul sneers at them, saying they only âseemed to be pillarsâ); Gal. 2:11-14 (âcondemnsâ Apostle Peter before âthem allâ); 2 Cor. 11:12-23, viz. verse 13 (âfashioning themselves into apostles of Christâ understood as allusion to the twelve being âfalse apostlesâ). See discussion in my prior work,<em> J</em><em>esusâ Words Only</em> (2007) at 336.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">After reviewing these passages in Galatians, Luther justifies Paulâs disarming behavior in Lutherâs commentary on Galatians chapter two. Luther embraces the idea that Paul was seeing the twelve apostles as false apostles from whom Paul (Luther implies) correctly desired to learn nothing. The twelve were advancing Jesusâ<strong><em> conditional gospel</em></strong>, and hence Paul saw them (correctly, according to the young Luther) as the enemies of the (supposedly true) unconditional gospel that Paul brought later. Luther writes:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Paul here explains his motive for going up to Jerusalem. He did not go to Jerusalem to be instructed or confirmed in his Gospel by the other apostles. [Gal. 2:6, the twelve apostles âimparted nothing to me.â] He went to Jerusalem<strong><em> in order to preserve the true Gospel for the Galatian churches and for all the churches of the Gentiles</em></strong>. When Paul speaks of the truth of the Gospel he implies by <strong><em>contrast a false gospel.</em></strong> The<strong><em> false apostles also had a gospel, but it was an untrue gospel</em></strong>. âIn holding out against them,â says Paul, âI conserved the truth of the pure Gospel....The false gospel has it that we are justified by faith, but not without the deeds of the Law. The<strong><em> false apostles preached a conditional gospel</em></strong>.â (Martin Luther, <em>Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians</em> (1535) (trans. Theodore Graebner)(Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Publishing House, 1949) at 48-60.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Luther must be correct that Paul viewed the twelve as false apostles for advancing Jesusâ conditional gospel as still valid. This perfectly explains why we find in Romans that Paul AT FIRST endorsed the Law and salvation by works (Romans 2:6-7; 3:31;7:12) â Jesusâ doctrine of salvation in the Gospel of Matthew.</span></p>
<h2>Examples of Paul's Guile in Romans About Salvation</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Specifically, in Romans <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+2%3A6-7&amp;version=KJV">2:6-7</a> (KJV) Paul affirms unquestionably the key component that good works plays in salvation as Jesus taught the rich young ruler in Matthew's Gospel and in Jesus' statement "every tree without <strong><em>good fruit</em></strong> is cut down and thrown in the fire" (Matt. 7:19). Paul says:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Who will render to every man according to his<em><strong> deeds</strong></em>:Â <sup>7</sup>To them who by patient continuance in <strong>well doing</strong> [<em>i.e., ERGA AGATHA -- "</em><strong>Good works</strong><em>"</em>]<em> </em>seek for glory and honour and immortality,<strong><em> eternal life</em></strong>:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">[See <em>Eerdman's Dictionary</em> at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=P9sYIRXZZ2MC&amp;lpg=PA1387&amp;ots=sBb0BFfCps&amp;dq=romans%202%3A6-7%20erga&amp;pg=PA1387#v=onepage&amp;q=romans%202:6-7%20erga&amp;f=false">1387</a> on "Works" in 2:6-7 -<em> erga</em>, meaning "human activity" / "works"; see <a href="http://bible.org/seriespage/study-and-exposition-romans-21-16">Bible.org</a>, confesses 2:7 means "good works"; see also <a href="http://biblos.com/romans/2-7.htm">Biblos Greek</a> - although it admits 'erga' is noun, it renders as verb 'doing.' See also Greek NT in transliterated form <a href="http://kesov.org/bible/gk_bible/45_002.htm">here</a>.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Indeed, in Romans 2:6-7 we find the conditional gospel of the 12, in particular the Gospel they quoted from Jesus in Matthew's Gospel. Paul says God will repay you for your deeds, and if you patiently do <strong><em>good deeds</em></strong>, God will render you "eternal life."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">But in a short span, Paul will take that all back. The most emphatic is Romans <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:3-5&amp;version=KJV">4:3-5</a> (KJV) -- which was the key passage upon which Luther built the faith-alone-without-works doctrine. Paul says there:</span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;"> </span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;"><sup>3</sup>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.Â Â <sup>4</sup>Now to <strong><em>him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace</em></strong>, but of debt.Â Â <sup>5</sup>But to<strong><em> him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">As commonly interpreted by faith-alone advocates, this teaches that Abraham was "ungodly" when he had his first faith, and this faith alone justified him (saved him by grace), but he "worketh not." This is construed to mean good works including repentance were not involved in Abraham's justification (salvation). This is our supposed model, regardless of what Jesus taught, and thus Paul is understood (and I believe this is the correct reading of Paul) to be teaching in Romans 4:3-5:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">God justifies the ungodly without repentance</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">God justifies the ungodly without any good work</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">God justifies the ungodly solely for belief</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Therefore, God justifies based upon faith alone.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">How do Paulinists reconcile this obvious use of guile between Romans 2:7 and Romans 4:5? We read one example:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Good works please God (Romans 2:7), and yet they are not faith (Romans 4:5). ("<a href="http://contendforthefaith2.com/romans45.html">Is Obeying God the same as Trusting God</a>" (2011).)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Yet, Romans 2:7 does not say that "good works <em><strong>please</strong></em> God...." No! It says "good works" are what you do patiently, and then God rewards you with "eternal life." So some Paulinists blind themselves so they do not have to confront the fact Paul used guile to affirm a truth he later disproves. Paul clearly used 2:7 to disarm the counter-attack of the 12 apostles or their allies, and once disarmed, he bombed them with Romans 4:5 to destroy their conditional Gospel -- the Gospel handed to them by Jesus Himself.</span></p>
<h3>FYI: Mistranslation of Gen. 15:6 Affects Paul's Conclusion</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Incidentally, Paul in Romans 4:3-5 relies upon a Septuagint mistranslation of the Hebrew of Gen. 15:6. The original passage, as it even reads in the KJV of Gen. 15:6 is: "And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness." Well, the second 'he' is interpolated to open up the possibility the second 'he' is not Abraham. However, in Hebrew there is no second 'he,' and instead the subject of the first clause -- Abraham -- is the intended subject of the second verb 'to count.' So it actually reads "he believed in the Lord and counted it to Him [i.e., God] as righteousness." (See our webpages where this is discussed: JWOS ch. 26 <a href="/JWOS/chapter-26-7jwo-genesis-156.html">part 7</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Hence,Â Abraham believed God about the promise of a child in old age (promised in the preceding verse - 15:5) and counted God's promise as righteousness toward Abraham. There is thus nothing here about salvation/justification when one reads the original Hebrew of Gen. 15:6.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Regardless, the point is that Paul in Romans 2:6-7 affirms salvation includes a component of good works, but in Romans 4:2-5 Paul denies that and says justification comes to the ungodly without any good works, and solely hinges on belief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Hence, the double-speak of Romans 2:6-7 would throw off the original twelve. Those passages made it harder to isolate Paul's contrary doctrine as his true position and hence made arguing against Paul virtually impossible or very difficult. Paul's defenders always could, and still do, <strong><em>cite the verses that conform to Jesus</em></strong>, while they privately know<em><strong> Paul does not stick with that view</strong></em>, and later unravels that view. They realize and defend this tactic among themselves as a purposeful and God-serving <em><strong>tactic of guile</strong></em>. They can beat back your criticism with some verses where Paul endorses Jesus' doctrine on salvation, the law, etc., but then squirm away in their own minds that it is necessary to use such guile then and even today to defeat those who follow Jesus' teachings on salvation. In the die-hard Paulinist mind, Jesus' teachings in the flesh are defunct, and part of a prior dispensation; only Paul supposedly carries the resurrected Jesus' message for the current dispensation. Â See our article, "<a href="/JWO/paulinism-examples.html">Examples of Paulinism</a>."</span></p>
<h3>Paul on The Law: Another Example of Paul's Use of Guile</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Another example of Paul's guile is Paulâs contradictory positions on the Law given Moses. First, Paul affirms belief in the Law given Moses. (Romans 3:31;7:12; Acts 24:14.) In particular,Â in RomansÂ <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203:31&amp;version=KJV">3:31</a> (KJV), we read:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, <strong>weÂ <em><strong>establish the law</strong></em></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Why did Paul initially affirm these truths only to undercut them later in Romans (as we shall see)? The gospel text by Matthew was circulating contemporaneously with Paulâs writings. Paul, having therebyÂ <em><strong>disarmed the twelveâs anticipated opposition that Paul was changing Jesus's view of the Law, </strong></em>NEXT slips in gradually and later strongly in the same epistle that the death of Christ put to death the bond of Israel to the Law which makes the Law now dead to us. We are now free to marry another without the bond to the old Law. (Romans 7:1-7. See our <a href="/JWO/romans-7-a-major-incongruity.html">extensive commentary on Romans 7:1-7</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Because of the pro-law passages in Romans 3:31, 7:12; Acts 24:14, faith-alone advocates can say Paul was â<em>slanderously reported to be an Antinomian</em>â [<em>i.e</em>., one who teaches the Law given Moses is abrogated]. (Edward Fisher, <em><em>The Marrow of Modern Divinity</em></em> (Boston: John Bryce: 1766) at ii.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">But nothing is more clear in Paulâs writing than that he taught the Law given Moses, including the Sabbath command (one of the Ten Commandments), was abrogated. See, Ephesians 2:15, Colossians 2:14, 2 Cor. 3:11-17, Romans 7:1-7; 7:13 <em>et seq</em>, and Galatians 3:19 et seq. For full discussion, see my prior book, <em>Jesusâ Words Only</em> (2007) at 83 et seq.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Hence, again, Paulinists can say Paul is not Anti-Law / Antinomian by citing some pro-Law verses. But when they think they have the 'laugh' on you, they reaffirm to themselves and their followers that of course Paul believed the Law is dead and gone. I assure you though, the last laugh will be on them -- and tragically so.</span></p>
<h3>Spiritual Damage Due To Paul's Boasting Of A Good Use of Guile / Deception</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Unfortunately, Paulâs example and words have had a tragic impact on Christian morals. Use of guile in argumentation became a revered principle of Roman Catholicism. Paulâs verse that he used â<strong><em>guile</em></strong>â was proof enough for Aquinas that âguileâ (deceit) â<em><strong>is no sin</strong></em>.â (<em>Summa Theologica</em> Art. 4:1.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Yet, Godâs position in all of this is ignored: â<strong><em>Guile </em></strong>is in the heart of them that <em><strong>think evil things</strong></em>.â (Prov.12:20.) The one who slays with âguileâ shall die. (Exodus 21:14.) Most <strong><em>ironic of all</em></strong> â because Paul in Romans 4:7 only quotes the first half of this verse to prove imputed righteousness by faith alone â Psalm 32:2 says: âBlessed is the man unto whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity, And in <strong><em>whose spirit there is no guile</em></strong>.â There it is again! The righteous â the ones without guile â are the ones to whom God will impute no prior sin based on atonement! You would deliberately have to twist that verse around so that a person <strong><em>with guile</em></strong> has no sin imputed to him!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Luther was tragically defending that when Paul admits he used guile to capture the Gentiles that this justifies Christian pastors to use double-speak. Many of Paulâs writings never allowed you to pin him down to a decisive criticism of abandoning Christâs doctrines unless you were willing to call him an out and out liar. Paul did this by using double-speak. Many faith-alone adherents still follow this model, and it takes careful dissection of their words to find their inconsistencies.</span></p>
<h3>Scripture Loses Integrity When One Of Its Speakers Can Speak With Guile</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">One problem with thinking an inspired person can talk with guile is that it leads to a <strong><em>dissolution of the integrity of Scripture</em></strong>. If you can explain away Paul whenever his teaching becomes demonstrably false / inconsistent with Jesus by admitting he was <strong><em>simply lying under inspiration</em></strong>, why would this not apply to everything Paul said? For example, even if Paul intended a doctrine to be followed, a Bible-based argument can always be that Paul was simply lying again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">For example, Luther and Calvin each insisted Paul says in Romans 13:1-3 that a Christian must accept tyrants as Godâs agents and thus a Christian must never seek revolution (even though Peter in Acts 5:29 speaks to the contrary). However, during the year 1776, colonial ministers who favored revolution said Paul did not mean what he said. In 1776, in a famous sermon PastorÂ West said as to Romans 13:1-3 that he âhad to conclude that the <strong><em>apostle Paul meant the opposite of what he said</em></strong>.â (Quoted in Frazer, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Political Theology of America's Founding</span> (2006)(referenced at this <a href="http://jonrowe.blogspot.com/2006/08/was-american-revolution-consistent.html">link</a>.) Westâs argument that Paul in effect LIED won the day among the religious colonial revolutionaries. (West's words on the right of Revolution later appear verbatim in the Declaration of Independence.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Thus, an entire countryâs origin, spiritually speaking, relies on saying Paul lied, which justified rejecting Paulâs express guidance and then going ahead into revolt! (We could revolt based upon Acts 5:29 and passages in OT on resisting oppression. We did not have to affirm Paul was a pious fraudster to do so as the colonialists chose to do to resolve the spiritual dilemma Paul presented.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">This historical episode illustrates clearly the <strong><em>ongoing danger of Paulâs presence in inspired scripture</em></strong>. His presence destroys the integrity of ever taking anything God says as true. It may be all a lie like when Paul says one thing but means the opposite about faith-and-works.</span></p>
<h3>Paul As A Master Of Guile Is The Only Way To Hold Onto Faith Alone</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Yet, recognizing Paul sometimes lies has been the only intelligible means for some who follow Paul's faith alone view to reject Paulâs just as clearly expressed view of the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">his support that faith-and-works are necessary for salvation (Romans <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%202:6-7&amp;version=NIV">2:6-7</a> "endurance in good works" (erga agatha) is unto "eternal life"); <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%203:31&amp;version=NIV">3:31</a> ("we uphold the Law"); <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%207:12&amp;version=NIV">7:12</a> ("the law is holy"); <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%208:13&amp;version=NIV">8:13</a> ("if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live"); 11:<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2011:20-22&amp;version=NIV">20-22</a>)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">justification comes by being "doers of the Law." (Romans <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%202:13&amp;version=NIV">2:13</a>)("Â those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.")</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">his support for salvation by repentance. First, he buffets his body so not to be "disapproved" / "rejected."Â 1 Cor. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor.%209:27&amp;version=YLT">9:27</a> (buffet body to prevent sin and become "disapproved"), Second, sorrowful repentance is unto salvation: (2 Cor.Â <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+7:9-10&amp;version=NIV">7:9-10</a> ("godly sorrow to repentance worketh salvation");</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">that one can lose their salvation due to disobedience or certain enumerated sins identified in the Law (1 Cor. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor.%206:9&amp;version=NIV">6:9</a>; Eph. 5:5-7; Gal. 5:19-20; 6:7-9; 1 Thess. 4:6-8);</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">we must work out our salvation with fear-and-trembling (Phil.<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=phil.%202:12-13&amp;version=KJV"> 2:12-13</a>), and</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">we cannot assure ourselves of personal justification before the day of Judgment for it would be prideful to do so even if we know of no present sin in ourselves. (1 Cor. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor.%204:1-5&amp;version=KJV">4:1-5</a>; Phil. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=phil.%203:12-13&amp;version=KJV">3:12-13</a>.)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">But against these verses are raised the crystal clear explanations by Paul that works do not profit at all, obedience to the Law can never save (even severs us from Christ to attempt to perform), and salvation is like Abraham's -- faith alone on a man supposedly who was an ungodly sinner / unrepentant at the moment he had faith. (Eph. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph.%202:8-9&amp;version=KJV">2:8-9</a>; Romans <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%204:4-5&amp;version=KJV">4:4-5</a>). "He who <strong><em>works not </em></strong>but <strong><em>believes</em></strong> on the one who <strong><em>justifies the ungodly</em></strong> (note: not the repentant) is being <strong><em>accounted</em></strong> with the faithfulness of Him unto <em><strong>righteousness</strong></em>." (Romans <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%204:4-5&amp;version=KJV">4:4-5</a>.) To gain this covering, one need only express belief once and one is saved forever. (Romans <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2010:9&amp;version=KJV">10:9</a>.) Then of course, any conditionality in ongoing good works / obedience/ repentance is erased by piling on top of these principles all the eternal security verses in Paul. Thus all the contrary bullet points above disappear into oblivion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">As a result, Paulinists teach if you make even one command, one act, or any effort at repentance, a requirement in addition to faith for salvation, Paul teaches you are lost! "<strong><em>But if you add something youÂ have cancelled it out</em></strong>.â (R.B. Thieme Jr., <em>Doctrine of Grace: Eternal Security</em> (May 19, 1988) lesson 814.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Consequently, no explanation of these conflicting messages is necessary for us dumb-folk by those who preach faith alone based upon Paul. Why? Because Paulinists believe their man justifiably uses guile to gain adherents to his point of view of faith alone. The Paulinist who is aware of the deceit too can play the same game, and boldly deny they 'see' the contradiction. They will straight-face insist these statements in the bullet-point list above are all compatible 'if you understand the full-context.' What they refuse to admit is<strong><em> these are self-contradictory doctrines by Paul</em></strong> because they do not want to admit what they privately believe: Paul<strong><em> spoke the bullet points as guile to draw you into an opposite gospel</em></strong>. The unconditional gospel as Luther identified it. A gospel Luther identified as opposite of the conditional gospel of the supposedly 'false apostles' <em>i.e.</em>, the 12 still laboring under the belief that Jesus's words in the flesh were still part of the current dispensation of the church.</span></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3>Leads To A Subjective 'What I Like' Hermeneutic To Rely Upon Self-Contradictory Paul</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">It begs all credulity that Paulinists can treat Paul as inspired when he talks like this. We supposedly know he is inspired when he talks one way, but somehow we just know he is uninspired and lying when he says things things that support an opposing view. This is simply a <em>subjective hermeneutic</em>. If applied to true Biblical passages, such thinking that God can speak in contradictions undermines taking any passage specifically in one direction if there is a less costly and more attractive cost-free alternative. We just follow the easy way, not the Way that Jesus said involved "agonizing" effort to enter.Â (Luke <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2013:24&amp;version=KJV">13:24</a>, Greek <em>agonozai</em>, tepidly translated as 'strive' in KJV.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Then what instead should have been the response from a follower of Christ? When we see someone using <strong><em>double-speak to maneuver around Jesusâ message given the 12</em></strong>, then this should have <span style="color: #ff0000;">raised an alarm</span>. When Paulinists admit Paul quotes the Master with âextreme rarityâ and came with a âfifth gospelâ wholly devoid of what is in the other four, a <span style="color: #ff0000;">red flag</span> also should have gone up. Finally, we should have immediately questioned the supposition of apostleship and inspiration of one engaging in what everyone (Paulinists included) admits is duplicity â a clear pattern of bait-and-switch.</span></p>
<h3>Rawlinson's Advice</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">A theologian once addressed the identical issue of how we must assess someone like this. When there are indications that someone is fraudulently trying to pawn off his words as inspired and part of the Bible, we must pause. Speaking of a passage at the end of the Torah that speaks of Moses' death, Rawlinson says this cannot be inspired scripture. In this context, Rawlinson expresses a valid principle. Rawlinson says if one engages in â<em><strong>impudent fraud</strong></em>âÂ to âpalm [off] on the world <em><strong>a gross and elaborate deception</strong></em>... [that is,] to obtain for <em><strong>his statements a weight and authority which they otherwise would not be entitled</strong></em>,â such duplicity should destroy âour confidence in<strong><em> the integrity of the author</em></strong>.â (George Rawlinson, âOn the Genuineness and Authenticity of the Pentateuch,â <em>Aids to Faith: A Series of Theological Essays</em> (Ed. William Thomson, D.D.) (N.Y.: Appleton &amp; Co., 1863) at 273, 279.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Similarly, while deception by Paul may be excused by Givens and others devoted to Paul, we should have instead lost all sense of confidence in Paulâs integrity if the case for guile be proven. And that case is impossible to deny. As Thomas Cosette recently wrote: âPaulâs teachings use the<strong><em> most double-minded expressions of thought and practice there is</em></strong>.â (Thomas L. Cosette, <em>Hebrew Prophecies of the Coming of Paul</em> (2007) at 37.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">When that is the inescapable conclusion, then how can we selectively pick verses to follow at odds with Jesus unless we are totally being subjective in our analysis? Arenât we just picking verses from Paul solely because they conform to our predilection of an easy path even when at odds with Jesus? Aren't we favoring the easiest possible gospel to sell? Isnât it human sensual thinking therefore that impels this desire for the easy way over the way that Jesus taught which He said requires âagonizingâ effort to enter?</span></p>
<h3>Do Not Let Paul Charm You Simply Because Sometimes He Taught Words Like Those of Christ</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">God is not amused by these developments. Paulinists may assume they can never be judged by the principles of repentance, good works, obedience, ongoing fear from sinning, or that charity is the most important virtue. They think they can insist Paul cunningly put those standards forth to throw off the âfalse [twelve] apostles.â Paul was supposedly acting with proper guile by pretending to endorse salvation principles based on faith-and-works, repentance and obedience in Romans 2:6-7; 3:31; 7:12; 8:13;11:20-22; Philippians 2:12-13; 1 Corinthians 4:2-5; 13:2,13; 2 Corinthians 7:9-10; Ephesians 5:6-7 and Galatians 5:19-20; 6:7-9, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">While Paulinists may think they will get away arguing this way with God, they are deluding themselves. God will never tolerate the idea that Paul could defend the allegedly true faith-alone gospel by deception and guile. God never could be the source of such bait-and-switch tactics.</span></p>
<h3>A Judgment Day Excuse For Following Paul?</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Or will God instead excuse the Paulinists because Paul had signs and wonders? Was it truly reasonable to assume Paul spoke from God because Paul was confirmed by âsigns and wondersâ? Indeed, Paul repeatedly defended himself from charges he brought a false gospel by insisting â<em><strong>signs and wonders</strong></em>â were the â<strong><em>signs of the apostles</em></strong>â that he enjoyed. (2 Cor. 12:12. See also Romans 15:19 âsigns and wondersâ validated himself.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">In other words, if signs and wonders are what Paul relied upon himself to prove his own validity, then will God have to accept that from you why you relied upon Paul? Will such an excuse protect you as a Paulinist if it turns out your confidence in Paul was misplaced?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Absolutely not! Jesus will respond to the die-hard Paulinists that He already said the âfalse prophetâ would come âin my nameâ with â<strong><em>signs and wonders to deceive</em></strong>, if possible, the elect.â (Mark 13:22-23; Luke 21:8.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">In fact, signs and wonders are precisely what God allows false prophets to have in order to test the faithfulness of His people â to determine whether he or she loves God with his or her whole heart, mind and soul. (Deut. 13:1-5.) The key question, God insists, is <span style="color: #ff0000;">not</span> whether the would-be prophet has âsigns and wondersâ <span style="color: #ff0000;">but whether such a pretender seeks</span> to â<strong><em>seduce you from the way you were commanded to follow in the Law (given Moses)</em></strong>.â (Deut. 13:3.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">As Tyndale says, this issue is whether such a pretender â<em><strong>juggles with [true] Scripture</strong></em>, and<strong><em> beguiles the people with false interpretations</em></strong>.â (<em>Obedience of a Christian Man</em>.) If so, God commands you to ignore such a would-be prophet despite verifiable âsigns and wonders.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">What borders on the bizarre is that many Paulinists are<em><strong> admitting Paul is a deceptive lying teacher to advance a gospel at odds with the pre-Ascension-Jesusâ gospel but yet Paul has the superior gospel</strong></em>. Jesus must be scratching His head in wonderment. How did these Paulinists ever rationalize their final position of faith alone with this sorry record?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">For you have their admission of following</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">a deliberately â<strong><em>false (guile-ful) prophet</em></strong>,â </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">who came in Jesusâ name based on â<em><strong>signs and wonders</strong></em>â </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">who has a â<strong><em>contrary gospelâ to Jesusâ Gospel</em></strong>. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">This is what Luther said in essence in his commentary on Galatians 2 which we quoted above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">How can anyone take these components, and rationalize a defense of holding onto a gospel from Paul at odds with Jesus? It makes no sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Consequently, on Judgment Day, Jesus will certainly not allow Paulinists to cite any faith-alone verse in defense. This is because Paulinists claim Paul was inspired. Since even Paul said â<strong><em>God cannot lie</em></strong>â (Titus 1:2), Jesus on judgment day is free to cite from Paul all the verses that prove Paul simultaneously endorsed salvation by obedience, repentance, and works -- the verses the Paulinists now place under the list of verses-by-guile to introduce 'faith alone' as the true doctrine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Hence, all such Paulinists who defend deception to ignore works and obedience verses in Paul will be fairly judged by all these verses anyway. God will not treat these verses as legitimate pious frauds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">If the Paulinist relied on faith-alone doctrine to their detriment (lived sinfully) or they misled just one person (let alone millions) into a lawless and non-salvific life, they only have themselves to blame for treating Paul as their teacher. For Jesus clearly said He Himself was the â<em><strong>Sole Teacher.</strong></em>â (Matt. 23:8-11.) He was the Way, not Paul. If these contingencies occur (<em>i.e.</em>, one soul is lost due to their false doctrine), these Paulinists will end up in the deepest darkness â the worst possible place in hell there is.</span></p>
<h3>What Does âSole Teacherâ Mean?</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">The author of the famous song <em>Amazing Grace </em>â Reverend John Newton (1725-1807) â explained this verse where Jesus cautions us against calling anyone else Teacher. Newton says it means that<strong><em> not even âthe bestâ </em></strong>of the ministers, pastors, etc., are âso thoroughly furnished, nor so free from mistake, as to <strong><em>deserve our implicit confidence [which Jesus alone deserves].</em></strong>â (Rev. John Newton, <em>The Works of the Reverend John Newton </em>(Hamilton &amp; Smith, 1821) Vol.7-8, Sermon 15, at 167.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">There was thus never any excuse for a true follower of Christ making Paul a teacher in Christâs church, let alone one superior to Christ in effect. Jesus is and always will be our Sole Teacher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Carlstadt had the priority of Jesusâ words right when he founded the German Reformation in 1517 with Luther. In his 1520 treatise, <em>De Canoncis Scripturis Libellus</em>, Carlstadt said:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">It is necessary in fact to preserve obedience to the Lord, and as the Spirit of the Apostles is not a guide equal or greater than the Lord, thus also the heart of<em><strong> Paul within his letters does not have as much authority as has Christ</strong></em>. (Charles Beard'sÂ <em>Martin Luther and the Reformation in Germany</em> (1889) atÂ <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=emIdSf6gTR0C&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;ots=k26bn6FeJ5&amp;dq=carlstadt%20canon%20paul&amp;pg=PA278#v=onepage&amp;q=carlstadt%20canon%20paul&amp;f=false"> 278</a> (reprint 2009) orÂ 1896 edition atÂ <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YlzNSeh7YgMC&amp;dq=Paulinum%20sub%20literis&amp;pg=PA401#v=onepage&amp;q=Paulinum%20sub%20literis&amp;f=false">401</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;">Unfortunately, rather than accept this correction, Luther was infuriated with his partner. Luther drove out Carlstadt from the reform movement, declaring Carlstadt <em>The New Juda</em>s. But Carlstadt was right: Jesus comes first. Everyone else is second tier. For there is only One Master. One Teacher.</span></p>

<h3>Study Notes</h3>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Given's Book</span></p>
<p>Scholar Mark Given states admits early on the truth about Paul's use of guile in his book <em>Paul's True Rhetoric</em> (Emory University, 2001), and lays out his biases:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Paul's rhetorical strategies...display such a degree of <strong><em>intentional ambiguity, cunning and deception</em></strong> as to make him justifiably vulnerable to the polemical charge of perpetuating sophistries." (Page 3)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I am quite sympathetic with Paul, but I am also sympathetic to Paul's critics." (Page 3.)</p></td>
