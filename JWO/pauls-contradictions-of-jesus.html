<h2>Paul's Contradictions of Jesus</h2>
<p>Here is a list of the major contradictions by Paul of things Jesus taught. Some of this was mentioned by others, so when applicable I quote and reference the source who mentioned this. This list is as of September 8, 2012. Come back for updates as I continue to add to this list. Please send me any that you have discovered.</p>
<h2>Jesus Says Not To Eat Meat Sacrificed to Idols, But Paul Says It Is Ok</h2>
<p>Three times Jesus in the Book of Revelation condemns eating meat sacrificed to idols, even saying this is the doctrine of a false prophet. (Rev.<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%202:6&amp;version=NIV"> 2:6</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%202:14&amp;version=NIV">14</a> (Ephesus); <a name="marker=464195"></a>Rev. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%202:14&amp;version=NIV">2:14</a>-15 (Pergamum); <a name="marker=464196"></a>Revelation <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%202:20&amp;version=NIV">2:20</a> (Thyatira).)</p>
<p>This absolute prescription also was set forth in James' ruling at the <a name="marker=464133"></a>Jerusalem Council in Acts <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2015:20&amp;version=NIV">15:20</a>. Then it is repeated when it was put in a letter. (<a name="marker=464137"></a><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2015:29&amp;version=NIV">Acts 15:29</a>.) Finally, James reiterates this for a third and final time in Acts chapter 21. James tells Paul that many claim Paul is teaching lawless doctrine. So James reminds Paul what was the ruling at the Jerusalem Council. He tells Paul that previously "we wrote giving judgment that they [<em>i.e</em>., the Gentiles] should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols...." (<a name="marker=464138"></a><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2021:25&amp;version=NIV">Acts 21:25</a>.)</p>
<p>However, Paul clearly teaches three times that there is nothing wrong in itself eating meat sacrificed to idols. (<a name="marker=464218"></a>Romans <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014:21&amp;version=NIV">14:21</a>;<a name="marker=464219"></a><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%208:4-13&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 8:4-13</a>, and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2010:19-29&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 10:19-29</a>.) The first time Paul addresses the question of "eating meat sacrificed to idols," Paul answers: "But food will not commend us to God; neither if we eat not...." (<a name="marker=464220"></a><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%208:8-9&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 8:8</a>.) Paul then explained it is only necessary to abstain from eating such meat if you are around a "weaker" brother who thinks an idol is something. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%208:7&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 8:7</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%208:10&amp;version=NIV">8:10</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%209:22&amp;version=NIV">9:22</a>.) Then, and only then, must you abstain. The reason is that then a brother might be emboldened to do something he thinks is sinful. The brother is weak for believing eating meat sacrificed to an idol is wrong. This is thus a sin for him to eat, even though you know it is not sinful to eat meat sacrificed to idols. Thus, even though you know better than your weaker brother that it is no sin to do so, it is better to abstain in his presence than cause him to sin against his weak conscience and be "destroyed." (<a href="/1 Cor. 8:11">1 Cor. 8:11</a>.)</p>
<p>As <em>Wikipedia</em> says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A major controversy among <a class="mw-redirect" title="Early Christians" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Christians">Early Christians</a> concerned whether it was permissible to eat meat that had been offered in pagan worship, see also <a title="Council of Jerusalem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Jerusalem">Council of Jerusalem</a>. <a title="Paul of Tarsus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_of_Tarsus">Paul of Tarsus</a>, who agreed to the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Apostolic Decree" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Decree">Apostolic Decree</a>, also wrote that<strong><em> it was permitted to do so</em></strong>, as long as a blessing was pronounced over it, and provided that <a title="Scandal (theology)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandal_(theology)">scandal</a> was not caused by it. ("<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolatry_and_Christianity">Idolatry and Christianity</a>," <em>Wikipedia</em>.)</p>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><strong>CAVEAT</strong>: The Law given Moses applicable to "foreigners/sojourners" (Gentiles) is a relatively small set of moral commands primarily from Leviticus, incorporating most of the Ten Commandments. So if the Law given Moses applies to Gentiles, it is not a burdensome list. Yet, we are still applying literally the Law, just as James did in Acts 15, by treating the term "foreigner/sojourners" versus "Israel" as literally as possible. This distinction perfectly explains why James said circumcision does not apply to Gentiles, <em>i.e.</em>, Leviticus <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus%2012:1-3&amp;version=KJV">12:1-3</a> only requires sons of "Israel" to be circumcised. See this <a href="/JWO/law-applicable-today.html">webpage</a> where we discuss this issue in more depth.</p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><strong>Jesus's View on the Law</strong>. Jesus emphasized the validity of the Law up through the passing away of Heaven and Earth, thus confirming its inspiration and ongoing validity. In Matthew <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:17-19&amp;version=ASV">5:17-19</a> we read:</p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><a name="pgfId=464422"></a>(17) Think not that I came to destroy<em><strong> the Law [of Moses] </strong></em>or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil. (18) For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in <strong><em>no wise pass away from the Law</em></strong>, till all things be accomplished [<em>i.e.</em>, all things predicted appear on the stage of history]. (19) Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and<em> <strong>shall teach men so</strong></em><strong>,</strong> shall be called <strong><em>least</em></strong> in the kingdom of heaven: but <strong><em>whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great </em></strong>in the kingdom of heaven. (ASV)</p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><a name="pgfId=464426"></a>Thus, Jesus can never be accused of seducing any Christian from following the Law. Jesus cannot be a false prophet under <a name="marker=464427"></a>Deuteronomy <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy%2013:5&amp;version=KJV">13:5</a> (false prophet is anyone who has miracles and wonders but seduces you from following the Law). Jesus said the Law remained valid until the Heavens and Earth pass away. This passing of heaven and earth occurs at the end of the Millennium. This is 1000 years after Christ's Second Coming, according to the Book of Revelation.</p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><strong>Paul's View on the Law</strong>. Paul says the opposite.</p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead">Paul is blunt in Ephesians 2:15, Colossians 2:14, 2 Cor. 3:11-17, Romans<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom.%207:13&amp;version=ASV"> 7:1-3</a> et seq, and Galatians 3:19 et seq. The Law is "abolished," "done away with," "nailed to a tree," "has faded away,' and was "only ordained by angels...who are no gods." If we were to cite Paul's condemnations of the Law in one string, the point is self-evident that Paul abrogated the Law for everyone. See Eph. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph.%202:15&amp;version=NIV">2:15</a> ("setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations"); Col. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col.%202:14&amp;version=ASV">2:14</a> ("having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us: and he hath taken it out that way, nailing it to the cross;") 2 Cor. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20cor.%203:14&amp;version=ASV">3:14</a> ("old covenant"); Gal.<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gal.%205:1&amp;version=ASV"> 5:1</a> ("yoke of bondage"); Rom. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom.%2010:4&amp;version=ASV">10:4</a> ("Christ is <em><strong>the end of the law</strong></em>"); 2 Cor. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20cor.%203:7&amp;version=ASV">3:7</a> ("law of death"); Gal. 5:1 ("entangles"); Col. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col.%202:14-17&amp;version=ASV">2:14-17</a> ("a shadow"); Rom. 3:27 ("law of works"); Rom. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%204:15&amp;version=NIV">4:15</a> ("works wrath"); 2 Cor.<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20cor.%203:9&amp;version=ASV"> 3:9</a> (ministration of condemnation); Gal. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gal.%202:16&amp;version=NIV">2:16</a> ("cannot justify"); Gal. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gal.%203:21&amp;version=NIV">3:21</a> (cannot give life); Col. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col.%202:14-17&amp;version=ASV">2:14</a> ("<em><strong>wiped out</strong></em>" exaleipsas); Gal. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23:1-15&amp;version=NIV">3:19</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gal.%204:8-9&amp;version=NIV">4:8-9</a> ("given by angels...who are no gods [and are] weak and beggarly celestial beings/elements").</p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead">Finally, in Romans<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A1-6&amp;version=NKJV"> 7:1-6</a>, Paul claims when Jesus died, the husband died and this dissolved the Law's bonds between the husband (God of Sinai) and wife (God's people). This henceforth made the "law dead to us." (Romans <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207:4&amp;version=NKJV">7:4</a>.) This death-of-God-the-husband released the Jews, Paul contends, and when Christ resurrected the bonds of marriage with the old God were not renewed.  (The implication, we contend, was Paul meant a new God emerges or otherwise if the same husband-God resurrected, why wasn't the bond to the Law renewed? Paulinists come near to admitting this is the only <em>logical</em> meaning while even confessing they are uncomfortable with the passage's 'seemingly' polytheistic explanation... Uggh. On our thorough analysis of Romans 7:1-6, see our <a href="/JWO/romans-7-a-major-incongruity.html">webpage</a> discussion.)</p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead">For more discussion on Paul's abrogation of the Law, see chapter five of <em>Jesus Words Only</em> excerpted at this<a href="/JWO/chapter-five-jwo.html"> link</a>.</p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead">How do those devoted to every word from both Paul and Jesus resolve the contradiction? Here is a perfect example:</p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="padding-left: 30px;">If [Jesus] is saying [in Matt 5:17 by saying He fulfilled the Law, and meant] he is the 'end of the Law' [as Paul taught in Romans 10:4], then why does he say in the next verse that the Law will never disappear? ...There is something exasperating about trying to understand a verse like this....What the verse seems to say<strong><em> contradicts what we know from other verses in the New Testament</em></strong>. The truth is <strong><em>we cannot be expected to understand this vers</em></strong>e.</p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead">Bivin, David. Blizzard, Jr., Roy.<em> Understanding the Difficult Words of Jesus: New Insights From A Hebraic Perspective</em> (Destiny Image, 2001) at 113.</p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead">Incidentally, Bivin-Blizzard offer a Hebrew approach that Jesus' means by saying he did not come to destroy the Law means his interpretations will not weaken its meaning, and <em>to fulfill</em> means to make it more lasting. Even with that, Bivin-Blizzard realize they haven't removed the contradiction between Paul and Jesus.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Paul Says The Pharisees Followed The Law Rigorously, But Jesus Says They Were Lax About The Law</h2>
<p>Paul says in Philippians <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians%203:5-6&amp;version=KJV">3:5-6</a> that as a result of his time as a Pharisee that "as touching righteousness, <strong><em>found blameless</em></strong>." Cf. Acts <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2026:5&amp;version=NIV">26:5</a> where Paul says "I conformed to the strictest sect of our religion, living as a Pharisee."</p>
<p>Of course, Jesus taught contrarily that the Pharisees were lax in teaching and obeying the Law. See Matt. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2023:23&amp;version=KJV">23:23</a>. <em>See also</em>, Matt. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2015:6,9&amp;version=KJV">15: 6,9.</a></p>
<p>Cosette in <em>Hebrew Prophecies of the Coming of Paul</em> (2007) correctly comments:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"One thing is for sure: one of the main messages that Y'shva [<em>i.e.</em>, Jesus] taught, which is recorded in all the gospels, is that the Pharisees were<strong><em> not teaching the law of Moses</em></strong> but rather the doctrines and traditions of men....All of Saul's (Paul's) writing clearly teaches the Pharisees taught the law of Moses <em><strong>perfectly</strong></em>." (<em>Hebrew Prophecies</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 20.)</p>
<p>This contradiction between Paul and Jesus has probably had the most important impact on doctrine. By perceiving the Pharisees through Paul's eyes, we are led to believe Jesus condemned the Pharisees as legalists -- Paul's view. However, Jesus condemned the Pharisees as<em><strong> ANTI-LEGALISTS</strong></em>. Jesus condemned them as teachers abrogating the Law by their man-made ordinances. (Matt. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2015:6,9&amp;version=KJV">15:6</a>). And Jesus condemned them as those who taught the lesser commands of the Law while ignoring the more weightier commands of the Law. (Matt. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2023:23&amp;version=KJV">23:23</a>.)</p>
<p>Hence, a wrong deduction is achieved by using Paul's contradictory perception of the Pharisees. Paul says the Pharisees are<strong><em> legalists</em></strong>; but Jesus says they are <em><strong>anti-legalists</strong></em>. These are <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>radically opposite perceptions</strong></span>. If Paul's view were correct, then Jesus impliedly condemned obedience any longer to the Law by criticizing the Pharisees. However, if Jesus's view of the Pharisees as lax about the Law is correct (and who can deny our Lord's veracity!), then Jesus condemned any teaching that either marginalized the Law or contradicted the Law.</p>
<p>This fits precisely into Jesus's statement: "he that teaches and keeps the Law of Moses <em><strong>will be great</strong></em> in the kingdom of heaven." (Matt.<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%205:19&amp;version=KJV"> 5:19</a>.)</p>
<p>However, because Paul depicts the Pharisees - enemies of Jesus - as law-keepers, Paul is understood to be "condemning all who are zealous of the Law of Moses as an enemy of Messiah." (Cosette, <em>Id.</em>, at 21.)</p>
<p>This means Paul indirectly<strong><em> condemned our Lord Jesus Christ</em></strong> when Paul condemned those who were teaching the Law should be followed, both big and little commands.</p>
<p><strong>CAVEAT</strong>: Please note that I have explained that the Law does not have but a relatively modest number of provisions that apply to non-Israelites/sojouners. It has provisions that specifically extend rules to sojourners/non-Israelites who join with the community. See this <a href="/JWO/law-applicable-today.html">webpage</a> where we discuss this issue.</p>

<h2><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Jesus Says Only God Is Your Spiritual Father, and Call No Man on Earth Your Father, But Paul Says He Is The Corinthians' Only Spiritual Father</span></strong></h2>
<p>Jesus said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">and ye may not call [any] your father on the earth, for<strong><em> one is your Fathe</em></strong><strong><em>r</em></strong>, who is in the heavens, (Matt. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2023:9&amp;version=YLT">23:9</a> YLT)</p>
<p>But Paul says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For even if you had ten thousand others to teach you about Christ, you have<strong><em> only one spiritual father</em></strong>. For <em><strong>I became your father</strong></em> in Christ Jesus when I preached the Good News to you. (<a href="http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Cor. 4:15</a>, NLT)</p>
<p>Incidentally, based on Paul, the Roman Catholic Church has countenanced the direct violation of our Lord’s words in calling a priest ‘father.’ See “Call No Man Father: Understanding Matthew 23:9,” <a href="http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0089.html">http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0089.html</a> (accessed 2010).</p>

<h2>Jesus Says Salvation Initiates And Continues By Repentance From Sin and Obedience Besides Faith; Paul Says This is Heresy</h2>

<li class="Bulleted"><a name="pgfId=464441"></a><a name="marker=464440"></a>Gal. 2:16 ("A man is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ, because by observing the law no one will be justified").</li>
<li class="Bulleted"><a name="pgfId=464443"></a><a name="marker=464442"></a>Ephesians 2:8-9 ("For it is by grace that you have been saved, through faith, this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast.")</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyAfterHead">Here where it matters most, Paul has a different voice than our Lord Jesus. Paul's themes are alien to Jesus's message of salvation. They undercut, if not destroy, the message of Jesus. The true sheep of Jesus recognize His voice, and will not follow another. (<a name="marker=464445"></a>John 10:27-29.)</p>

This interpreted Paul as saying our salvation initiates by faith, but is maintained by works, including repentance. See our book, JWOS <a href="/images/stories/Salvation/preface specially formatted.pdf">Preface</a> (PDF). For a very good defense of this notion, using Paul's present v. past tense reference to saved, see this<a href="http://www.christian-history.org/not-by-faith-alone.html"> webpage</a> from Christian History.org. However, the error in this is Jesus says salvation initiates, such as for the Prodigal, by repentance from sin, while Paul contrarily says, and double justification continues the notion, that it initiates by faith alone.</span></p>

<h2>Jesus Tells Apostles To Teach His Commands Given Prior to His Ascension While In The Flesh, But Paul Says Not To Do So (Per Bultmann's Reading)</h2>
<p>After the Risen Lord proved He had the same nail holes as He had on the cross, Jesus' final words just before He ascended into heaven were that the then Apostles should teach "<strong><em>everything that I commanded you</em></strong>...." Matt. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt.%2028:20&amp;version=NIV">28:20</a>.</p>
<p>Jesus must have meant to teach all His commands prior to the Cross, and not simply any given after He rose from the dead and prior to Ascension. How do we know that?</p>
<p>The reason we know this is true is because none of the four gospels contain any post-cross commands. If Jesus meant by His command to teach the world "all that I have commanded you" (Matt. 28:20) to teach only His commands <strong><em>post-resurrection</em></strong>, the four gospels would have contained such commands. However, there are none quoted except the command in Matt. 28:20 to teach Jesus'commands previously given. Hence, Jesus clearly meant by "everything I commanded you" to be His words in His earthly ministry <strong><em>before His resurrection</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Hence, Jesus could only have meant that post-Ascension the apostles were to teach the <strong><em>pre-Cross teachings of Jesus</em></strong> -- while He was clearly "in the flesh."</p>
<p>However, Paul's statement in 2 Corinthians 5:16 is interpreted to justify rejecting this.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>16</sup>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though <em><strong>we have known Christ after the flesh</strong></em>, yet now <strong><em>henceforth know we him no more</em></strong>. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:16-17&amp;version=KJV">KJV</a>)</p>
<p>The famous and influential evangelical theologian Rudolf Bultmann said 2 Corinthians 5:16 means we no longer know Christ in the flesh, <em>i.e.</em>, we supposedly can dispense with Jesus's teachings when He was in the flesh. Paul tells us that only the messages Paul received from the resurrected Christ -- who supposedly no longer had flesh -- is the means to know Christ any longer. Indeed, Origen and Clement in the early church read "in the flesh" in 2 Cor. 5:16 to mean the period of Christ's earthly preaching. (See our discussion at this <a href="/JWO/2-corinthians-516.html">link</a>.)</p>
<p>Read this way by Bultmann, Paul tells us we no longer know or need to know Jesus' message delivered pre-Resurrection when He was in the flesh.</p>
<p>This is also how the Christian theologian and physician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer">Albert Schweitzer</a> (1875-1965) viewed 2 Cor. 5:16 in his book of 1911 <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=J8HhOwAACAAJ">Geschichte Der Paulinischen Forschung</a> </em>(J. C. B. Mohr) at 191 (and in English translation, <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NRBmPQAACAAJ">Paul and His Interpreters</a>: </em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NRBmPQAACAAJot;%3E%20%3C/a%3Eof%201912,%20at%20245).%20Schweitzer%20believed"><em>The conception of authority in the Pauline writings</em> (1918) at </a><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2XJCAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Albert%20Schweitzer%202%20cor.%205%3A16&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">36</a>.) Schweitzer explained: "since the death and resurrection of the Lord [Paul believed] conditions were present that were so <strong><em>wholly new</em></strong> that they <em><strong>made his [Jesus's] teaching inapplicable</strong></em><em>.</em>" (<em>Id</em>.) Thus, Albert Schweitzer says this is what explains Paul's failure to mention any significant teachings of Jesus: "If we had only St Paul to guide us, we should not know that Jesus spoke in parables, that He spoke the Sermon on the Mount and taught His people the Lord's Prayer."</p>
<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Indeed, with the sole exception of the eucharistic formula at 1 Cor 11:24-25, Paul does not quote any sayings of the historical Jesus as found in the written Gospels. Furthermore, Paul never even once alludes to the panorama of the Savior's life story from the Nativity up to the Passion, as well as Jesus's elaborate teaching, which fill the pages of the first four books of the New Testament.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">By contrast, and astonishingly, at Acts 13:<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2013:24-25&amp;version=NIV">24-25</a> Paul does quote </span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">John the Baptist from the written gospels</span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">!  And the Jesus of Paul quotes Greek works more frequently than Jesus's words. See our article <a href="/JWO/pagan-influences-in-writings-of-paul.html">Pagan Influences on Pau</a>l.</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> Hence, Paul was</span><span><strong><em> a well-read man but never thought Christ's teachings in the flesh which we find in the gospels were of any importance to relate to the Romans, Corinthians, Ephesians, Thessalonians, etc</em></strong></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">As a result, Bultmann saw things the same way as did Albert Schweitzer. As one commentator on Bultmann summarized his influential view of 2 Corinthians 5:16, Paul deliberately ignored Jesus' teachings during His earthly ministry because Paul discovered a new and different preaching than what Christ taught pre-resurrection. This rendered supposedly defunct that prior message of Jesus:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Bultmann...regards the </span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">historical Jesus as</span><span> irrelevant</span></em><span> </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">as to the </span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">kerygma</span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;"> [</span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">i.e.</span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">, preaching] of the risen Lord whom Paul proclaimed. Bultmann understood 2 Corinthians 5:16 ("even though</span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"> we once knew Christ</span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">kata sarka </span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">[through/by</span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"> means of the flesh</span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">], we</span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"> know him thus no longer</span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">") to mean that </span><span><em>Paul chose not to employ his knowledge of Jesus kerygmatically</em></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> [</span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">i.e.</span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">, for preaching], a view with which Bultmann agreed [with Paul.]. Accordingly, the influential scholar of Marburg [</span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">i.e.</span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">, Bultmann] declared Paul the "founder of Christian theology." (Paul Barnett, </span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">Paul: Missionary of Jesus</span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;"> (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2008) at </span><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=J7tnFxRTlbYC&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Bultmann%20Theology%20of%20Paul%20irrelevant%20jesus&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=Bultmann%20Theology%20of%20Paul%20irrelevant%20jesus&amp;f=false"><span style="font-weight: normal;">13</span></a><span style="font-weight: normal;">.)</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Hence, Paul is viewed to instruct us no longer to teach Jesus' teachings while Jesus was in the flesh, </span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">i.e., </span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">from His earthly ministry (2 Cor. 5:16). But Jesus commanded to the contrary that we do so in Matthew 28:20. Hence, 2 Cor. 5:16 contradicts Matt. 28:20 as Paulinists construe 2 Cor. 5:16.</span></p>

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>Paul Says Elders Are Entitled To Pay for 'Preaching &amp; Teaching,' But Jesus Says No</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="p3"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In </span><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;">1 Tim. 5:17,</span> </span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Paul wrote: "The elders who </span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">direct the affairs of the church </span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching." Then Paul uses a verse about not muzzling an ox in an odd extension to imply churchgoers have a duty to pay the elders for their service. (1 Tim. 5:18.) Elsewhere, Paul says:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; padding-left: 30px;" class="p3"><sup>14 </sup><span>In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+9%3A14&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 9:14 </a>NIV.)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-weight: normal;">But I thought Jesus said to His disciples to lay no cost on anyone they served by preaching and healing? "Without cost you have received; </span><span><strong><em>without cost you are to give</em></strong></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">." (Matt. </span><a href="http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/matthew/matthew10.htm" style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">10:8</span></a><span style="font-weight: normal;">, NAB.) Jesus in the prior verse was commanding the apostles to go out and preach the gospel, so the context makes quite clear that no charge was to be made on auditors to hear preaching of the gospel or healing ministries.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Hence, 1 Tim. 5:17-18 and 1 Cor. 9:14 contradicts Jesus in Matthew 10:8.</p>
<p class="p3">Compare: Micah 3:11 WEB says:</p>
<p class="p3"><span>11 Her leaders judge for bribes,</span><br /><span>and<strong><em> her priests teach for a price</em></strong>,</span><br /><span>and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money:</span><br /><span>yet they lean on Yahweh, and say,</span><br /><span>“Isn’t Yahweh in the midst of us?</span><br /><span>No disaster will come on us.”</span></p>

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;"></h2>
<h1 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jesus Teaches There Are Only 12 Apostles Into Eternity, But Paul Adds Himself To The List As a Thirteenth</span></h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="p3"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Matthias was voted to replace Judas in Acts 1. Hence, the 12 were established long before Paul became a Christian.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="p3"><span style="font-weight: normal;">However, our Savior made the permanent tally of the Apostles established at exactly twelve --- for obvious reasons of historical symbolism. One can see the historical symmetry at Rev 21:12-14. Twelve apostles to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Paul was never numbered in that circle; not even Barnabas in his Epistle recognizes Paul’s Apostleship!: "[The Apostles] to whom he gave the power of the Gospel to preach; and</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><em> there are twelve as a testimony to the tribes</em></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">, because there are</span><span><strong><em> twelve tribes </em></strong></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">of Israel." (Epistle of Barnabas</span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/barnabas.html"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> 8:3</span></a><span style="font-weight: normal;">).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-weight: normal;">However, Paul repetitiously claimed he was an apostle. Yet, not once did Jesus ever call Paul an apostle. Read for yourself Paul's vision accounts in Acts 9, 22 and 26</span><strong>. In these accounts, Jesus said Paul would be a </strong><em>martus</em><strong>. </strong>That means "witness," not "apostolos" (messenger).</p>

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>Paul Exhorts Celibacy, But Jesus Clearly Says It is A Choice Not Within Everyone's Power</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Paul taught against being married. He wrote in 1 Cor. 10:27-28:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Are you bound to a wife?  Do not seek to be free.  Are you </span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">free from a wife</span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">? </span><span><strong> Do </strong></span><em><span><strong>not seek marriage</strong></span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">.  But if you marry, you do not sin, and if a girl marries she does not sin."</span></p>
<div style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In line with this Paul also wrote:</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I wish all were as I am," meaning unmarried. (1 Cor. 7:7.)</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"></div>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;"></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"></div>
<div style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">To help prevent the desire to be married, Paul said: ‘It is good that a man should not touch a woman.’ (1 Cor. 7:1.)</span></div>
<div style="font-weight: bold;"></div>

<div style="font-weight: bold;"></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"></div>
<div style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If Paul is a true prophet and wishes something, such as avoiding touching a woman and to not "seek to be married," then Paul clearly endorses celibacy for us too as a superior way of life.</span></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">However, Jesus speaks differently of celibacy as something for some but not all disciples. It is not a command or even an exhortation. It is merely a legitimate option. "He who is able to receive this, let him receive it." Matt. 19:12.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The contradiction arises because Jesus never says or implies "do not seek marriage." Significantly, Jesus never applies any moral suasion or pressure to be celibate, while Paul clearly does so.</span></p>

However, Jesus said, in a correction of Pharisees who thought an oath offered "by" articles offered at the Temple were binding but not an oath by the Temple at Jerusalem itself: "And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by</span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span><span><strong>the one who dwells in it</strong></span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">."

Hence, Jesus's logic was that because the article of the Temple is less important than the Temple</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><em> where God dwells </em></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">at Jerusalem, an oath "by" the Temple is as binding as an oath by an article.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Paul says that none is righteous under the law, that obedience to the law justifies no one before God, and that the law was a curse:</strong><br /><br /><span>Ro 3:10 - As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</span><br /><br /><span>Ro 3:19 - Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. 20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</span><br /><br /><span>Gal 3:10 - For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. 11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. 12 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. 13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</span><br /><br /><strong>But the Lord Jesus says there were many who were righteous under the law:</strong><br /><br /><span>Mt 13:17 - For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</span><br /><br /><span>Mt 23:3 - That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.</span><br /><br /><span>Mt 23:29 - Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,</span><br /><br /><strong>In fact, some of the righteous under the law during the lifetime of both Jesus and Saul were:</strong><br /><br /><span>Elizabeth and Zechariah, the parents of John the Baptist: Lu 1:6 - And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</span><br /><br /><span>Simeon, who waited to see the Messiah: Lu 2:25 - And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.</span><br /><br /><span>Joseph the husband of Mary, and Mary herself who was chosen to be Jesus’ mother: Mt 1:19 - Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example,was minded to put her away privily.</span><br /><br /><span>John the Baptist: Mr 6:20 - For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</span><br /><br /><span>Why did Saul contradict the Lord? The answer is simple: Saul misunderstood the relationship between the Law and the Love.  [See <a href="http://false-apostle-paul-archive.blogspot.com/2009/12/post-from-michaeleden-of-theology.html">Messenger's article</a> 2006]</span></p>

<h2>Paul Excludes Eating With Sinners Unlike Christ's Own Example</h2>
<p>In 1 Cor. 5:9, Paul clearly writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: 5:10 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. 5:11 But now I have written unto<em> you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat</em>. 5:12 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? 5:13 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</p>
<p>What did Pharisees like Paul say was Jesus' sin or error?<strong><em> Eating with sinners.</em></strong> Hence, 1 Cor. 5:9 contradicts Jesus's clear practice of eating with sinners.</p>
<p>The only argument Jesus agrees with Paul comes from Jesus' direction that within the church, we were to confront brothers / sisters with sins against us, and only after this process is taken in two unsuccessful steps, then you should treat the sinner as a tax collector / sinner. See Matt. 18. Yet, it is not clear that this means not eating with them, as Jesus made a point to eat with tax collectors and sinners. Treating someone as a tax collector apparently meant treating them differently. This could be not giving them greetings of shalom or visiting them in their home as John speaks to limit contacts with certain heretics. It does not necessarily mean not eating with them, and in light of Jesus' practice of eating with sinners, we should not construe it to prohibit doing so.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Paul Teaches In Original Sin But Jesus Contradicts</strong></h2>
<p>Truth Seekers explains:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Paul has managed to contradict Jesus in almost every single area of faith and practice. Jesus says that there is no original sin (Mark 9:13-14) while Paul says there is (Rom. 5:12-14). ("<a href="http://www.truthseekers.co.za/content/view/87/53/">Can Paul Be Trusted</a>")</p>
<hr />
<h2>Jesus' Command About Callling Anyone Fools</h2>
<p>Truth Seekers argues:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you think you are wise by this world's standards, you will have to become a fool so you can become wise by God's standards.” – I Corinthians 3:18 (NLT). <br /><br />[T]hese statements... contradict Jesus who said: “Whosoever shall say, Thou fool , shall be in danger of hell fire” (Mathew 5:22). According to Jesus, calling someone a fool may make you worthy of Hell yet becoming a fool is a prerequisite of faith according to Paul! Also see Romans 1:22 where Paul calls the Romans “fools.” ("<a href="http://www.truthseekers.co.za/content/view/87/53/">Can Paul Be Trusted</a>.")</p>

<h2>Who Should We Follow/Imitate? Paul? or Jesus?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Peter tells us to imitate Christ. The author of Hebrews (Barnabas) likewise says Jesus is our example. But Paul says we are to imitate and follow himself. I am quoting here from "Church Myths -- Church of Christ or Paul" by an anonymous author:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In church do the sheep learn all about Jesus and what He instructs? Not as a rule. They are taught the gospel of Paul and not the gospel of Jesus. Well you may ask what is the difference. Well the main difference is that Jesus was God proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom. Jesus was to be our perfect example on how to live, yet Paul in his letters tells us how to live. Jesus told us to follow Him alone, yet Paul says 1Co 4:16 "Wherefore I beseech </span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">(beg)</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> you,</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> be ye followers of me</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">." ... It is the Pope of Rome that instructs "his" church to be followers and imitators of himself. As a follower of Christ, I would NEVER tell some one to follow me. We follow Jesus only! Paul says,</span><span style="color: #990000;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Brothers, be imitators together of me, and mark those who walk this way, for you have us for a pattern."</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> Phi 3:17 (Church Myths - Church of Christ or Paul?

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Feed The Poor But Paul Puts Up Barriers</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I am quoting here from "Church Myths -- Church of Christ or Paul" by an anonymous author:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">What Jesus taught and what Paul taught was two different things. Here is a few quick example. Jesus instructs us to feed the poor. Paul says, </span><span style="color: #990000;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"For even when we were with you we gave you orders, saying, If any man does no work, let him not have food. For it has come to our ears that there are some among you whose behavior is uncontrolled, who do no work at all, but are over-interested in the business of others."</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">2Th 3:10 Jesus said to feed the poor. He did not say feed the poor unless they are over interested in other people's business. This is what Paul does. He pontificates endless rules of conduct, yet from the other side of his mouth he says we are free in Christ? (Church Myths - Church of Christ or Paul?

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Faith Alone Or Obedience to Christ?</h2>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Paul paints a picture of us being free from the law because of Jesus' sacrifice. Nothing could be further from the truth. Jesus came to fulfill the law and to empower us with His Holy Spirit so that we can keep the law. Yet Paul says,</span><span style="color: #990000;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> "Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds (works) of the law." </span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Rom 3:28 Elsewhere he sates that God </span><span style="color: #990000;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"...imputes righteousness without works." </span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Rom 4:6 Paul is saying here that salvation is through faith alone and that we do not need works such as works repentance and works of righteousness.

<h2>Paul Denies Obedience Grants Any Righteousness Unto Life, But Jesus Says It Does</h2>
<p><span>Paul says that "</span><em>if there HAD been a law given which <strong>could have</strong> given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law." (</em><span>Gal 3:21). This tells me that Paul believed that no such Law ever existed that could give eternal life. This is in direct contradiction with Jesus; "If you want to enter life, obey the commandments." (Mat 19:17)  [Contributed by David B. 12/3/2011]</span></p>
<p><strong>Saul preached that the law cannot justify or make man righteous before God:</strong><br /><br /><span>Ro 3:20 - Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</span><br /><br /><span>Ro 4:15 - Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</span><br /><br /><span>Ga 2:16 - Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</span><br /><br /><span>Ga 3:11 - But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</span><br /><br /><strong>In contrast, the Lord affirmed the law, came to fulfill his part in it, and exhorted his hearers to obey it. Thus:</strong><br /><br /><span>Mt 5:17 - Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</span><br /><br /><span>Mt 7:12 - Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</span><br /><br /><span>And the Lord added that, beyond or on top of the life that the law gives, he offers perfection to those who would follow him. Thus:</span><br /><br /><span>Mt 19:16 - And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? 17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. 18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, 19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? 21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</span><br /><br /><strong>In summary, Paul’s gospel says:</strong><span> Never mind the law; just believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you are saved. Thus many believers disregard the Ten Commandments without feeling guilty, believing that they have been saved by faith in Christ, and that once saved, always saved. But if they cannot enter life, how can they go to perfection?</span><br /><br /><strong>But the Lord’s gospel says:</strong><span> Obey the law and enter life, then achieve perfection by following him. Faith in him makes easier entry to life and achievement of perfection, because the Holy Spirit puts and writes the law in our minds and hearts. But the Holy Spirit does not dwell in unclean vessels. The correct sequence therefore is: Repent, forgive, believe in Christ, be baptized, and the Holy Spirit will indwell us and lead us to life (by obeying the Law) and perfection (by following Christ in agape love).</span><br /><br /><span>Paul quoted from Psalm 14 and used a tiny truncated phrase to make a huge generalization to set aside the Law. Fully read, Psalm 14 clearly states that while none is righteous among the fools and children of iniquity, God always has a righteous generation who keep the Law.

<h2>Pleasing To All Men: A Good Thing or a Bad Thing?</h2>
<p>Paul says: "<span>Even as I please all </span><em>men</em><span> in all </span><em>things</em><span>, not seeking mine own profit, but the </span><em>profit</em><span> of many, that they may be saved."<a href="http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/10-33.htm"> 1 Cor. 10:33</a> (KJV)</span></p>
<p>Contrast what Jesus says about winning over all men so they speak well of you:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span>'Woe to you when <em><strong>all men shall speak well of you</strong></em> -- for according to these things were their fathers doing to false prophets." (<a href="http://bible.cc/luke/6-26.htm">Luke 6:26</a> YLT)</span></p>
<p>Then Paul contradicts himself, implying that what he says in 1 Cor. 10:33 proves he is not serving Christ. Good luck to the Paulinists to unravel this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>10 </sup><span>Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or<em><strong> am I trying to please people? </strong></em></span><em><strong><sup></sup></strong></em><span><em><strong>If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ</strong></em>.

<h2>Extra Material: Paul's Contradictions of Yahweh in Original Testament</h2>
<h3>God Will Not Justify Ungodly But Paul Says He Does</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">"I will <strong><em>not justify the ungodly</em></strong>." (Exodus <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2023:7&amp;version=KJV">23:7</a>, KJV, ASV.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">"He that <strong><em>justifieth the ungodly</em></strong> ...[is] <strong><em>an abomination</em></strong> to Yahweh." (Proverbs <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs%2017:15&amp;version=KJV">17:15</a>.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But Paul says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on <em><strong>him that justifieth the ungodly</strong></em>, his faith is counted for righteousness." (Romans <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:4-5&amp;version=KJV">4:5</a>, KJV.)</p>
<p>In context, all mainstream scholars concur Paul means God justified Abraham before Abraham repented of unrigteousness. Unlike Exodus and Proverbs quoted above, Paul in Romans 4:3-6 intends us to understand that by faith alone, <em>i.e.</em>, believing God as did Abraham (which was that he would have a child through Sarah in his old age) while we are ungodly, we are justified. This is why all mainstream scholars say Paul taught justification <strong><em>without repentance from sin</em></strong>, but based upon faith alone.</p>
<p>However, in Ezekiel we learn that only upon repentance including turning from evil did the ungodly receive life (<em>i.e.</em>, eternal life) and hence were justified.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><sup>14</sup>Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if<em><strong> he turn from his sin</strong></em>, and <strong><em>do that which is lawful and right</em></strong>;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><sup>15</sup>If the <strong><em>wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live</em></strong>, he shall not die.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><sup>16</sup>None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live. (Ezekiel <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel%2033:14-16&amp;version=KJV">33:14-16</a>.)</p>
<p>Likewise, Jesus teaches justification is solely by repentance from sin in the Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican. The one who went home "justified" is the one who beat his breast and asked God to be "merciful to me, a sinner," but the Pharisee (who believed in Yahweh) was smug that he had not sinned and went home unjustified. See Luke <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2018:9-14&amp;version=KJV">18:9-14</a>.</p>
<h3>Paul Says Jesus Is The First-Born Son But God Says Israel Is His First-Born Son</h3>
<p>Paul in Colossians 1:15 calls Jesus the "protokos" -- first born. <span>Paul said Jesus "is the image of the invisible God, the<em><strong> firstborn of  all creation.</strong></em>" (NASB)</span> (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%201:15&amp;version=ESV">ESV</a>)(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%201:15&amp;version=ASV">ASV</a>)(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%201:15&amp;version=KJV">KJV</a>)(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%201:15&amp;version=YLT">YLT</a>)(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%201:15&amp;version=NIV">NIV</a>) Paul says Jesus is the "Son of God" in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%201:4&amp;version=ASV">Roman 1:4</a>. Hence, Paul called Jesus the "firsborn...son" of God.</p>
<p>But in Exodus 4:22, we read that Israel -- the name of Jacob which God changed to Israel --- is His true first-born son: “This is what YHWH says: Israel is my <strong><em>firstborn son</em></strong>. . . .” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ex%204:22&amp;version=NIV">NIV</a>)(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ex%204:22&amp;version=KJV">"my firstborn" KJV</a>)(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ex%204:22&amp;version=ASV">"my son, my firstborn" ASV</a>)</p>
<p>What underscores Paul's contradiction of Scripture is that Exodus 4:22 in the Greek translation of 257 BC known as the Septuagint renders this with "protokos" (see this <a href="http://en.katabiblon.com/us/index.php?text=LXX&amp;book=Ex&amp;ch=4&amp;interlin=on">link</a>) -- the same word Paul said applied to Jesus. But there cannot be two protokos -- first-born, and hence there is a contradiction by Paul of the Original Testament given by God to Moses.</p>
<h3>Paul Delivers A Slave Back to His Master, Contrary to Scripture</h3>
<p>While in prison, Paul met a runaway slave, Onesimus, the property of a Christian -- presumably Philemon. Paul<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';"> sent the slave back to his owner. This action is forbidden in Deuteronomy 23:15-16:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee."</p>
<p>"He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than give the slave sanctuary, Paul returned him to his owner. Paul seems to hint that he would like Philemon to give Onesimus his freedom, but does not actually request it.</p>
<h2>Paul's Contradictions of Himself</h2>
<h3>1. 'Resurrection At Baptism' - Oops! 'I Meant Resurrection Has Not Yet Happened!'</h3>
<p>Paul in 2 Timothy 2:18 condemns heretics who claim "The resurrection has already taken place."</p>
<p>One commentator points out the heretics had reasonable support in the words of Paul for what Paul condemns in 2 Tim. 2:18:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Concerning the resurrection, Paul’s baptismal theology might be seen to imply that<em><strong> the believer has risen with Christ in baptism</strong></em> (Rom. 6; Col. 2). Concerning the body, Paul had said that <strong><em>flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God</em></strong> (1 Cor.15:50). In other words:<strong> could not the heretics attacked in the Pastorals claim Paul’s support for their doctrines?</strong> There is, in fact, a distinct possibility that they did so. (Oskar Skarsaune, “Heresy and the Pastoral Epistles,” <em>Themelios</em> 20.1 (October 1994): 9-14, at 10 available in PDF at this <a href="http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/heresy_skarsaune.pdf">link</a>.)</p>
<p>Skarsaune cites in support several scholars who construct the arguments of condemned groups who relied upon Paul's words for this very doctrine that the resurrection of Christians already has happened:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Elaine Pagels, ‘“The mystery of the resurrection”: A Gnostic reading of 1 Corinthians 15’,<em> JBL</em> 93 (1974), pp. 276-288; idem, <em>The Gnostic Paul. Gnostic Exegesis of the Pauline Letters</em> (1975); and the wise cautions in A. Lindemann, <em> Paulus im ältesten Christentum. Das Bild des Apostels and die Reception der paulinischen Theologie in der frühchristlichen Literatur bis Marcion</em> (Beiträge zur hist. Theol. 58, Tübingen, 1979), pp. 297-343.</p>
<h3>2. 'Circumcision Will Cause Christ No Longer To Benefit You Unless I Arrange For You To Be Circumcised'</h3>
<p>Paul was willing to appear he and his closest followers were outwardly righteous but inwardly Paul did not believe in the necessity of believing in the external action performed to appear righteous.</p>
<p>For example, as to Timothy’s circumcision, Luke records:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him.” (Acts16:3)</p>
<p>But elsewhere Paul says: “I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision,<strong><em> <em><strong>Christ will be of no advantage to you</strong></em></em></strong>. I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that<strong><em> he is obligated to keep the whole Law</em></strong>” (Gal5:2).</p>
<p>So was Timothy not obligated to keep the whole Law? Or did Timothy and Paul participate in a hypocritical show of obedience to the Law just like the Pharisees whom Jesus condemned for such behavior?</p>
<h3>3. 'We Are Released From The Law But We Also Uphold The Law'</h3>
<p>An identical self-contradiction in Paul arises relating to Paul's view of the Law.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“But now <strong><em>we are released from the Law</em></strong>.. we serve not under the old written code but under the new life of the Spirit” (Romans7:6).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Compare this with</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, <strong><em>we uphold the law!</em></strong>” (Romans 3:31).</p>
<p>Which way is it?</p>
<h3>4. 'Outer Cup Clean Is Enough Even Though I Do Not Have To Obey The Law'</h3>
<p>We see Paul's willingness to mold himself to whom he wishes to win rather than have a non-hypocritical integrity. Listen to this next quote, and keep in mind what Jesus said about Pharisees like Paul who wash the outside of the cup but inwardly do not have the heart that follows their actions -- they are hypocrites. Paul says he is ‘all things to all men’ in this passage:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. <strong><em>To those under the law I<strong><em> became as one under the law</em></strong> (though <strong><em>not being myself under the law</em></strong>)</em></strong> that I <strong>might win those under the law</strong>. To those outside the law<strong><em> I became as one outside the law</em></strong> (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that <strong><em>I might win those outside the law</em></strong>. To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have<em><strong> become all things to all men, that I might save some</strong></em>.” 1Cor9:20+.</p>
<p>With this hypocritical strategy, Jesus said the Pharisees could not save anyone, <em><em>i.e.</em>,</em> could not lead anyone to God. Instead, Jesus said their followers would become twice the sons of hell (Matt. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23:1-15&amp;version=NIV">23:15</a>) as the hypocritical teachers who taught like Paul explicitly does.</p>
<h3>5. Bearing Burdens of Others or Just You of Yourself</h3>
<p>This is a clear self-contradiction by Paul that has no explanation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>2 </sup><span>Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+6%3A2&amp;version=NIV">Gal 6:2</a> NIV)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><sup>5 </sup><span>For every man shall bear his own burden. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%206:5&amp;version=KJV">Gal 6:5</a>.)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So am I supposed to bear your burden, and you mine, or each of us is to bear our own burden?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By the way, the true God teaches neither is correct. Instead:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><strong><em>“Cast your burden on the Lord–and He will sustain you.”</em></strong><br /></span><span>Psalm 55:21</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Peter talks likewise:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em><span>“Cast all your cares upon Him–because He cares about you!”</span></em></strong><br /><span>1 Peter 5:7</span></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While Paul may say some things worthy of praise, Paul is fraught with contradictions of Jesus, the OT, and with his own self! Paul could not be a true inspired individual in every word he spoke, and thus we have erred treating Paul's words in that manner.</p>
