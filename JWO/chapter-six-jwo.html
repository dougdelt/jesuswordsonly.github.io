<h2>Chapter Six: Paul Contradicts Jesus Over Idol Meat</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BodyAfterHead">Jesus in Revelation 2:6, 14 takes on those persons teaching the Ephesians that it was acceptable to eat meat sacrificed to idols. Among them Jesus says were the Nicolaitans. The Nicolaitans were an actual historical group. They taught Paul's doctrine of grace permitted them to eat meat sacrificed to idols. Jesus commends the Ephesians for refusing to listen to the Nicolaitans on the issue of eating meat sacrificed to idols.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BodyAfterHead">Yet the Nicolaitans were not merely deducing it was permissible to eat such meat from Paul's doctrine of grace. Paul, in fact, clearly teaches three times that there is nothing wrong per se in eating meat sacrificed to idols. (Romans 14:21;1 Corinthians 8:4-13, and 1 Corinthians 10:19-29.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BodyAfterHead"><a name="pgfId=464119"></a>However, Jesus, as we will see, three times in Revelation says it is flatly wrong. The Bible says when God commands something, we are not free to "diminish" it by articulating our own exceptions. "What thing soever I command you, that shall ye observe to do: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it." (<a name="marker=464120"></a>Deut. 12:32, ASV.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BodyAfterHead"><a name="pgfId=464121"></a>Let's explore thoroughly the origin of this command against eating meat sacrificed to idols. Let's see also the starkness of the contradiction between Paul and Jesus.</p>
<h2><em>Jerusalem Council Ruling on Meat Sacrificed to Idols</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BodyAfterHead">Acts chapter 15 recounts James' ruling at the Jerusalem Council. The issue presented was whether circumcision was necessary for salvation. The outcome was a decision involving what behaviors Gentiles had to follow as Christians. The first decision was to prohibit Gentiles who wanted to become Christians from committing fornication. The second decision was to prohibit eating meat sacrificed to idols. This principle is drawn from Exodus 34:13-16.<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" class="footnote" href="#pgfId=464128"> 1</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BodyAfterHead">Paulinists claim that this prohibition on eating meat sacrificed to idols (which was sold in meat markets) was not an absolute command. It was flexible enough to fit Paul's approach. Paul taught idol meat was perfectly acceptable unless someone else thought it was wrong. Paulinists argue that the Jerusalem Council only meant to prohibit eating such meat if it would undermine a weaker brother who thought it was wrong, as Paul teaches.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BodyAfterHead"><a name="pgfId=464131"></a>However, there is no basis to believe the prohibition in Acts chapter 15 is merely a prohibition on undermining someone else, causing him to violate his conscience. It is clear that eating meat sacrificed to idols is simply wrong in itself. It is also no less absolute a prohibition than the prohibition on fornication. Had the Jerusalem Council ruling intended the eating-idol-meat rule to be only a command to follow during social intercourse, then the council used the wrong words to convey such an interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BodyAfterHead"><a name="pgfId=464132"></a>In fact, the prohibition on eating meat sacrificed to idols was stated three times in Acts. It was never once stated with an exception or qualification. There is no hint that eating such meat was permissible in your private meals. In fact, when we later look at Jesus' words in Revelation absolutely condemning such practice, Jesus is talking after Paul's words are written down. Had Jesus intended to affirm Paul's view that eating such meat is permissible, Jesus' absolute directives against ever eating such meat were the wrong way to communicate this. Jesus left no room to find hairsplitting exceptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BodyAfterHead"><a name="pgfId=464134"></a>This absolute prescription first appears at the <a name="marker=464133"></a>Jerusalem Council in Acts 15:20. Initially, James decided that "we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols...." (<a name="marker=464135"></a>Acts 15:20.) Second, Luke then quotes <a name="marker=464136"></a>James' letter to the Gentiles as saying one of the "necessary things" is "you abstain from things sacrificed to idols." (<a name="marker=464137"></a>Acts 15:29.) James reiterates this for a third and final time in Acts chapter 21. James is reminding Paul what the ruling was at the Jerusalem Council. He tells Paul that previously "we wrote giving judgment that they [i.e., the Gentiles] should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols...." (<a name="marker=464138"></a>Acts 21:25.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BodyAfterHead"><a name="pgfId=464139"></a>James restates the principle unequivocally. It is a flat prohibition like any food law or the prohibition on fornication. As James states the rule, it has nothing to do with rules only at social gatherings. It has no limited application. There is no exception to permit eating idol meat at home.</p>

Jesus says "some... hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock (skandalon) before the children of Israel, to <a name="marker=464144"></a>eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication." Jesus does not say the error was eating meat sacrificed to idols only if you believed an idol was real. Nor did Jesus say it was wrong only if the person involved thought eating such meat was wrong. Jesus simply laid down a prohibition. Nothing more. Nothing less.<a name="marker=464145"></a>Deuteronomy 4:2 prohibits "diminishing" from God's true inspired words by making up exceptions.</p>

Hence, Jesus was telling us in Revelation 2:14 that eating meat sacrificed to idols was a serious sin. He called it a skandalon--a trap. It was a salvation-ending trap.</p>

It is no coincidence. The Ephesians' rejection of someone who said he was an apostle but could not be in Rev. 2:2, if this were Paul (see Chapter Ten), would have to go hand-in-hand with the Ephesian's rejection of Paul's doctrine that idol meats were permissible.</p>

<h2><a name="32195"></a>Paul Permits Eating Meat Sacrificed To Idols</h2>

(<a name="marker=464218"></a>Romans 14:21;<a name="marker=464219"></a>1 Corinthians 8:4-13, and 1 Corinthians 10:19-29.) The first time Paul addresses the question of "eating meat sacrificed to idols," Paul answers: "But food will not commend us to God; neither if we eat not...." (<a name="marker=464220"></a>1 Cor. 8:8.) Paul then explained it is only necessary to abstain from eating such meat if you are around a "weaker" brother who thinks an idol is something. (1 Cor. 8:7, 8:10, 9:22.) Then, and only then, must you abstain. The reason is that then a brother might be emboldened to do something he thinks is sinful. The brother is weak for believing eating meat sacrificed to an idol is wrong. This is thus a sin for him to eat, even though you know it is not sinful to eat meat sacrificed to idols. Thus, even though you know better than your weaker brother that it is no sin to do so, it is better to abstain in his presence than cause him to sin against his weak conscience and be "destroyed." (1 Cor. 8:11.) <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" class="footnote" href="#pgfId=464223">4</a></p>

At the same time, Paul insists as a matter of principle, there is nothing wrong eating such meat. If you were instead the weaker brother, and read Paul's epistles on this topic, you certainly would walk away knowing Paul teaches it is permissible to eat meat sacrificed to idols. You would even think your weak-mindedness on this issue should be abandoned. You should no longer burden your conscience on your brother who refrains due to your overly sensitive conscience. With Paul's instructions in hand, you would certainly know that it is permissible to eat meat sacrificed to idols. You can now get over your undue and ill-founded concern about eating such meat.</p>

He thereby is "diminishing" Jesus' words by contradicting Him. Paul is prohibiting eating such meat only if someone else is foolish enough to think eating such meat is wrong. Paul has turned Jesus' words on their head. Paul developed a relativistic approach that swallowed the rule. He made the prohibition of none effect. Paul's words clearly violate <a name="marker=464228"></a>Deuteronomy 4:2 and <a name="marker=464229"></a>12:32. James and Jesus both say eating meat sacrificed to idols is flatly prohibited and wrong. There are no excuses, hairsplitting qualifications, situational-ethics, or easy outs in deciding whether to obey God. It is wrong and prohibited.</p>

Paulinists defend Paul's position that eating idol meat is permissible by saying the Law was abolished. They then insist this means that any legalistic notion to not eat meat sacrificed to idols was abolished. In fact, these same Paulinists ridicule any first century Christian who would have tried to enforce the command against eating such meats. The Law has been utterly abolished, they explain.<a name="marker=464245"></a></p>

Jesus is looking at Paul's entire outlook on the Law. Paul's broader message is because there is no Law any longer, it is permissible to eat such meat. Paul, in fact, says James' command in Acts 15:20 against eating such meat is not binding. The Laws of Exodus are not directed to God's people. You apply an expediency test whether to follow it or not. Jesus was the end of the Law, as Paul says. (<a name="marker=464266"></a>Rom. 10:4.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BodyAfterHead"><a name="pgfId=464267"></a>Jesus' remarks prove Pastor Hill's notion cannot possibly be true. Jesus is angry to the hilt in <a name="marker=464268"></a>Revelation 2:6, 14. He is upset that Christians are being told they can commit fornication. He is furious they are told they can <a name="marker=464269"></a>eat meat sacrificed to idols. If there is no more strict Law for Christians, and just expediency is the test, then Jesus' words are pointless. We are covered. There is no <a name="marker=464270"></a>condemnation for those in Christ Jesus. (Romans 8:1.) Jesus apparently had not read that passage. He didn't `learn' its truth. Instead, Jesus is full of condemnation for Christians who violate laws!</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BodyAfterHead"><a name="pgfId=464271"></a>In truth, Jesus in Revelation chapter 2 is clearly attacking antinomianism. He is laying down absolutes on fornication and eating meat sacrificed to idols. Jesus is highlighting the error of the <a name="marker=464272"></a>Nicolaitans. They were known from Irenaeus' writings to be antinomians. Irenaeus said they believed they could eat any foods. The Nicolaitans taught the Law was abrogated and they lived under grace instead.<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" class="footnote" href="#pgfId=464278"> 9</a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Jesus' attack on antinomianism is also obvious from Jesus' condemnation of the permissiveness on the issue of fornication. Jesus is not only prohibiting fornication at idol worship ceremonies, as a few Paulinists contend. To save Paul's validity, some seriously contend Jesus meant to prohibit fornication only at idolatrous ceremonies. However, no such limitation can be found in the text. The fornication prohibition is stated just as absolutely as the prohibition on eating meat sacrificed to idols. There are no exceptions. There are no plausible hairsplitting arguments that can construe Jesus as only prohibiting fornicating at a pagan ceremony. (If true, it would imply Jesus permitted fornication otherwise.) This spin to save Paul leads to absurdities.</span></p>

(16) By their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? (17) Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</p>

Obviously evil fruit. Jesus says "beware those who come in sheep's clothing." (<a name="marker=464300"></a>Matt. 7:15.) What is a sheep in that verse? A Christian. Beware those who come claiming to be a Christian but who have evil fruit. Paul fits both criteria. Jesus then continues, saying even if they come with signs and wonders, He will tell those who work anomia (negation of Mosaic Law) that He never knew them. (<a name="marker=464301"></a>Matt. 7:23.)</p>

In Exo 34:15-16, God says if you prefer making a covenant and allow their pagan altars, you risk "one call thee [to eat with him] and thou eat of his sacrifice." The command to destroy the pagan altars was so that Jews would avoid <a name="marker=464129"></a>eating meat sacrificed to idols even inadvertently at a meal at a Gentile home. This altar-destruction command also had the indirect affect of preventing a Gentile from eating idol meat. For this apparent reason, James in Acts 15:20, 25 and 21:25 prohibits Gentiles from eating idol meat. (On how James construed when the Law applies to Gentiles, see <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" class="XRef" href="/chapter 5.#20427">See Luther Was Sometimes On the Right Track In This Sermon</a> .) It is ludicrous to argue, as some do, that God was concerned only that one knowingly ate such meat. If true, the Bible could have just prohibited such food as it did with other foods. However, idol meat cannot be identified by appearance. Thus, merely prohibiting eating such meat would not be enough if God was displeased by you eating it unknowingly. Hence, to prevent unknowing eating of such meat, God commands the destruction of pagan altars. Thus, Paul's allowance of eating such meat by not asking questions is precisely what the Bible does not countenance. Rather, if a Jew lived in a society where pagan altars operated and idol meat was sold in the market, the Law intended the Jew not to eat meat whose origin he/she could not be sure about.</p>

This was thus not a flat prohibition on eating idol meat. Most commentators reconcile Paul to Paul by saying Paul means you cannot go to a pagan sacrifice and eat the meat during a pagan service and still partake of communion. There is still thus nothing inherently wrong in eating such meat. In the context in which Paul says this, Paul also repeats his famous axiom, "all things are lawful, but not all things are expedient." (1 Cor. 10:23.) Then Paul says when you buy food or eat a stranger's home, "ask no question for sake of your conscience." (1 Cor. 10:25,27.) Thus, Paul says it is best you not know what you are eating. Don't let your conscience dictate questions about what you are eating. In a sense, Paul believes it is better you not know the meat's origin rather than try to scrupulously avoid eating such meat.</p>

(Exodus 34:15-16.) Since the Gentiles were now equal in the sight of God, this restriction was no longer necessary. Jewish Christians even preferred idol meat since it was usually less expensive in the market place....Paul stipulates another reason why idol meat is permitted: `As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one....' (1 Corinthians 8:4-6)."</p>
