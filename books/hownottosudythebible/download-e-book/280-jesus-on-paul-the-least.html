<h1>Jesus Unflatteringly Prophesies Of Paul in Matthew 5:17-19</h1>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Scholars going all the way back to Augustine say Paul was playing on the meaning of his name as "least" when he tells the Corinthians:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">For I am the&nbsp;<strong><em>least</em></strong> of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:9&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 15:9</a>)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">However, these scholars' admissions will lead to the unraveling of Paul under a prophecy of our Lord.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Paul's Name is Paulus</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Luke tells us Saul was "also known as Paul." (Acts <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013:9&amp;version=KJV">13:9</a>.) In the Greek, "Paulos." Paulos means 'small one' in Greek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Whence came that name? And what does it mean?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">First, "Paulos" (Acts 13:6) is a transliterated Greek version of the Latin name "Paulus." In other words, Paulos is the Greek form of the Latin "Paulus."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">In Latin, "Paulus" is a shorted form of the name "Pauxillus," just like we say "Joe" for the name "Joseph."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Why did Paul have a Latin name? Luke tells us Saul of Tarsus was a Roman citizen by birth. Acts<a href="http://bible.cc/acts/22-28.htm"> 22:28</a>. This is verifiable because 100 years earlier,&nbsp;Roman politician Anthony had conferred Roman citizenship upon all the inhabitants of Tarsus, and this was later attested to by Emperor Caesar Augustus. (See<span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"> Barnes' Commentar</span>y notes at this&nbsp;<a href="http://bible.cc/acts/22-28.htm">link</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">However, to receive Roman citizenship, a Jew had to give the child a second name in Latin belonging to the benefactor bestowing citizenship:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">"When a foreigner received the right of citizenship, he<em><strong> took a new name</strong></em>, which was ar­ranged on much the same principles as have been ex­plained in the cases of freedmen. His original name was retained as a sort of&nbsp;<em>cognomen</em>, and before it were written the praenomen that suited his fancy and the&nbsp;<em><strong>nomen of the person, always a Roman citizen, to whom he owed his citi­zenship</strong></em>.&nbsp;" Harold W. Johnston,&nbsp;<em>The Private Life of the Romans </em>(Revised by Mary Johnston) (Scott, Foresman and Company: 1932) ch.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forumromanum.org/life/johnston_2.html">2</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">So besides a Jewish name like Saul, his father had to give his son a Roman name -- this is evidently why Paul has a Latin name Paulus. He would be known as "Paulus Saul." In the Greek NT, Paulus was transliterated as "Paulos."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, because Paulus is a shortened form of the name Pauxillus, what does it mean in Latin?</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Paulus/Pauxillus Means 'Least"</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Paulus / Pauxillus in Latin means "<em>least</em>."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">In the&nbsp;<a href="http://jfb.biblecommenter.com/1_corinthians/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a> to explain why Paul calls himself the "least" of the apostles in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:9&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 15:9</a>, they point out the meaning of Paul's true Latin name:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">"The name, "Paulus," in Latin, means "<em><strong>least</strong></em>." (See also Biblos <a href="http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">quote</a> of Jamieson).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Likewise, we read in Farrar, <em>The Life and Work of St. Paul </em>(E.P. Dutton, 1880) at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Nx5VAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=paulus%20means%20least&amp;pg=PA200#v=onepage&amp;q=paulus%20means%20least&amp;f=false">200</a> the meaning of Paul's name, and how Augustine ca. 390 AD explained Paul used it in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:9&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 15:9</a>:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Who will the occupants of the kingdom of heaven call "least," according to our Lord Jesus? After mentioning the Law given Moses and the Prophets, Jesus says:</span></p>

Allison try to cast the issue less than certain (what in history is 100% certain?) by speculating others were equally anti-Law, and not just Paul, and perhaps Matthew did not know Paul's name meant "least." But otherwise, they admit too much. As followers of the Messiah-Yashua, we believe Jesus is speaking. The fact Matthew could not reasonably have known Paul's name meant 'least' in Latin bolsters this is a prophecy of our Lord rather than raises a question mark about whether Matthew understands what he is saying could apply to Paul. Indeed, the fact Matthew would lack the necessary knowledge of Latin to forge a prophecy like this into the text proves it is a true prophecy from our Lord Jesus about Paul. For Jesus certainly foresaw prophetically the Paul of several years in the future who would have a name meaning "least" in Latin. The fact Matthew would have no clue to a Latin meaning to "Paul" proves this is a genuine original prophecy of our Lord Jesus recorded by Apostle Matthew. Here is their nervous admissions: </span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">It has, from time to time, been urged that Matt 5:19 adverts to Paul, who in one place called himself the 'least' of the apostles. (1 Cor. 5:19, the <strong><em>Latin Paulus = small</em></strong>). Now there is no doubt the polemical tone of 5:19: <strong><em>the verse was obviously formulated with laxness toward the Law in view. And we cannot exclude the possibility that Paul was originally the intended target</em></strong>. But this possibility remains far outside the bounds of certainty. There were many besides Paul who, at least in the eyes of others, sat loose to the Law....And in any case one cannot be certain that Paul was known as the 'least.

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">But the skepticism of these scholars that Matthew could not likely know Paul's name meant 'least' to discount this applies to Paul is proof itself this is a prophecy of Jesus.

<h3><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">So Who Is Called "Least" and Taught The Relaxation Of The Law?</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul taught “the Law was our custodian until Christ came” (Gal.3:24) but since then, Jesus was “<strong><em>abolishing in his flesh the Law of commandments and ordinances</em></strong>” (Ephesians 2:15).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">And Paul's name means "least" in Latin!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">What prescience and subtlety had our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">And thus all Paulinists who proudly proclaim Paul as their own wear the brand of our savior on their doctrine as one condemned. They are all followers of the "Least."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Called By Those in the Kingdom Does Not Place The Least One In The Kingdom</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Some try saying 5:19 is about "the least<strong><em> in</em></strong> the kingdom of heaven," and thus the least is at least saved. Implicitly, this response seeks to weaken our concern if we follow the 'least' man, as Jesus describes this law-loosening teacher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">However, please scrupulously note it does not say in 5:19 the "least<strong><em> in</em></strong> the kingdom of heaven," but instead says "the least [he is]&nbsp;<strong><em>called in the kingdom of heaven</em></strong>," as the YLT correctly translated this verse. The Greek words&nbsp;in Matt 5:19 are "<em>elechistos kiethestai en te basileia ton ouranon</em>." Literally "<strong><em>least shall [he] be called in the kingdom of heaven</em></strong>." It NEVER SAYS the "least in the kingdom; rather "least shall [he] be called in the kingdom of heaven." The presence of the verb "<em><strong>call</strong></em>" between "<em><strong>least</strong></em>" and "<em><strong>in the kingdom</strong></em>" makes clear Jesus is not saying this "least" man is in heaven. Rather, those "in the kingdom" shall call this law-loosener "the Least."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">The YLT brings out this important grammatical difference, which I will quote again so one can see the true grammatical construct of the sentence:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><sup>19</sup>`Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands -- the least -- and may teach men so,&nbsp;<strong><em>least he shall be called in the reign of the heavens</em></strong>, but whoever may do and may teach [them], he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens. (Matt.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:19&amp;version=YLT">5:19</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">It is verse 20 that proves the "least" one is lost (absent repentance) because Jesus then requires an obedience from us greater than the Pharisees. Jesus elsewhere explained why: the Pharisees had a shallow view of the Law which Jesus identified in Matt. 23:23 (regard for the lesser command of tithing but the Pharisees leave the rest undone).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">As a result, <strong><em>every scholar</em></strong> found who addresses this issue concurs that 5:19 means the “least” one remains outside the kingdom and is lost (absent repentance). For example,&nbsp;Adam Clarke, the famous Methodist commentator, explained in 1825 that “least” in 5:19 is understood as excluded from heaven, proven by 5:20:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">“He who, by his mode of acting, speaking, or explaining the words of God, sets the holy precept aside, or explains away its force and meaning, shall be called<em><strong> least</strong></em> --<em><strong> shall have no place in the kingdom of Christ here, nor in the kingdom of glory above</strong></em>. That this is the meaning of these words is evident enough from the following verse [i.e., 5:20].” (Adam Clarke, <em>The Holy Bible</em> (1825) Vol. V at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=I6kGAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=shall%20have%20no%20place%20in%20the%20kingdom%20of%20Christ%20here%2C%20nor%20in%20the%20kingdom%20of%20glory%20above%20clarke&amp;pg=PT35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">56</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Likewise, Alexander B.

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">In accord in reading 5:19-20 i<span data-mce-mark="1">s the Protestant classic text, </span><span data-mce-mark="1"><em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament</em> (ed.G.W.

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Matthew Henry, the famous commentator, had the same opinion:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">He that does so, shall be called&nbsp;<em>least in the kingdom of heaven,</em> in the kingdom of glory; he shall <em><strong>never come thither, but be eternally excluded</strong></em>; or, rather, in the kingdom of the gospel-church.

(<a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/matthew/5.html">Henry on 5:19</a>, Bible Study Tools.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Gill in his famous treatise suggests initially two possibilities on what "least" means, but then in light of 5:20, he ends up pointing toward exclusion from heaven as what 'least' signifies. He writes:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong><em>the least in the kingdom of heaven</em></strong>;&nbsp;meaning either the church of God, where he shall have neither a name, nor place; he shall not be in the least esteemed, but shall be cast out as a worthless man; or the<strong><em> ultimate state of happiness and glory, in the other world</em></strong>, where he <strong><em>shall not enter, as is said in the next verse</em></strong>; (Gill on 5:19, <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/matthew-5-19.html">Bible Study Tools</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><em>Cf</em>. Augustine <em>Sermon on the Mount</em> ch. <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf106.all.html">VIII</a> from Schaff, Nicene and Post-Nicene ("'the least one in the kingdom of heaven'...perhaps he will not be in the kingdom of heaven at all.")</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">This vast consensus underscores Jesus was speaking of Pharisees, which includes Paul, and Jesus identified that henceforth those who would be teachers that the Law is annulled / loosened and not to be obeyed would be called "Paul" / "Paulinists."

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">So here we see Jesus threatens hell (if no repentance) upon the Pharisees and those following their teachings which minimize the Law to tithing, omitting, neglecting or leaving undone the weightier matters of the Law. It is the same point Jesus made in Matt. 5:19-20.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">This does not mean all who accept Paul in canon are not going to enter heaven; it means all those who disregard the Law in reliance upon the Pharisee Paul, and do not do better in relation to the Law, will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Obedience to God's Law is crucial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">(FYI: The Law applicable to Gentiles is expressly far more narrow in the Law itself. It predominantly includes several chapters in Leviticus which largely repeat the 10 commandments apply to Gentiles.

<h3><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Matthew 5:19 Is Hence Another Amazing Prophecy of Jesus</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Jesus therefore prophesied -- for those who have ears to hear -- of Paulus -- the one who would come teaching men to no longer follow the Law. It was supposedly done away with, nailed to a tree, and made "dead to us." (Romans 7:1-6.) Indeed the one so teaching has that very name -- the "Least" -- Paul -- and will forever be called by that name by those entering the kingdom of heaven!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">What an amazing prophecy of our Lord! It ranks up there right next to His prophecy that the Temple would one day be torn down. And His prophecy of the ravening wolves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Unfortunately, this means that unless Paul and every Paulinist repented / repents before death of such doctrine and<em><strong> turns in obedience</strong></em>, it appears their doctrine is a damning one.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Confirmation from Book of Revelation That Jesus Warns of Paul</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Corroboration that Jesus intended in Matthew 5:19 to prophesy about Paul (as a test) comes from examining how SUBTLY Revelation chapter two does likewise. It is an entire chapter of our Lord’s words. This prophecy about Paul is admitted by Renan, a defender of Paul, but he claims Rev. 2:2 were words put in Jesus' mouth by the early church leaders who hated Paul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Renan in his famous defense of Paul in 1875 discounted Revelation chapter two as inauthentic because it was supposedly fabricated by Apostle John and the other apostles out of jeolousy against Paul. However, if we conclude Jesus really spoke it, then the same<strong> subtle message</strong> against Paul is in Revelation chapter two just as we find in Matthew 5:19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Renan argued:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">“The <strong><em>second and third chapters of the Apocalypse are a cry of hatred against Paul</em></strong> and his friends. This church of Ephesus, which owes so much to Paul, is praised for ‘not being able to bear with them which are evil; for having tried them, which say they are apostles and are not &nbsp;for having found them liars; for hating the deeds of the Nicolaitanes,... because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel,<em><strong> to eat things sacrificed unto idols</strong></em>....” (Ernest Renan, <em>Saint Paul</em> (G.W. Carleton, 1875) at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NN8TAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=intitle%3ASaint%20intitle%3APaul%20inauthor%3ARenan&amp;pg=PA220#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">220</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Why is Revelation chapter two supposedly a hateful diatribe? Because Renan is aware that Paul teaches three times that there is nothing wrong in itself eating meat sacrificed to idols. (Romans 14:21;1 Cor. 8:4-13, and 1 Cor. 10:19-29.) And the words in Jesus' mouth in Revelation chapter two condemn this figure as a false prophet and apostle exposed at Ephesus.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Paulinists Know Paul Is Targeted by Matthew 5:19 and 23:23</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">For reasons similar to Renan's argument, the NT scholar E.P. Sanders in <em>Jesus and Judaism</em> (Foretress Press: 1985) at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ng9JaKKaeCIC&amp;lpg=PA277&amp;dq=jesus%20obey%20the%20pharisees&amp;pg=PA277#v=onepage&amp;q=jesus%20obey%20the%20pharisees&amp;f=false">277</a> defends Paul by saying Matt. 5:19 which contradicts Paul cannot thus be “an authentic saying of Jesus.” Sanders likewise says the related verse of Matt. 23:23 which portrays Jesus as believing the Pharisees are “not righteous enough” and that Jesus “favors a higher righteousness according to the law” which is at total odds with Paul proves Matt. 23:23 also does not reflect “the historical Jesus.” (As discussed above, Matt. 23:23, 31 confirms Jesus teaches the Pharisees had an anti-Torah position, except tithing, that Jesus said was damning.)</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Desperation To Destroy Three Passages From Jesus</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">So the Paulinist is forced to deflect Jesus criticizes Paul -- subtly obviously -- by insisting Matthew 5:19 and 23:23 as well as all of chapter two of Revelation were fabrications. This is what Renan and Sanders collectively say is necessary to conclude so as to prevent our recognition that Jesus condemns Paul!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">But for the one following Jesus Christ--our one and only teacher--the solution is not to dump Jesus' words in favor of Paul's. Rather, we discard Paul's contrary teachings. We need to hold onto those of our Lord Messiah.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: large;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Conclusion</span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Why then did Paul end up in Scripture?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">It is a test from God. In Deut. 13:1-5, God says He permits false prophets to come and potentially seduce us to see whether we Love the Lord our God with our whole heart, mind and soul. We have to look at fruit as well as consistency with Torah/the Law and the Messiah's Words. Paul fails in every respect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Have you passed the test from God on how to weigh Paul?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 12pt;" data-mce-mark="1">The End</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Study Notes: Dead Sea Scrolls and Josephus Say Pharisees Are Loose About The Law</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">E.P. Sanders in the quote above dismisses the authenticity of Matthew 23:23 because he 'knows' the Pharisees were legalists, not anti-legalists. However, only Paul in the NT says the Pharisees were the "strictest" sect and that Paul was fully "righteous" when he complied with Pharisee training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">However, history has now caught up with Paul, and confirmed Jesus had the correct historical truth about the Pharisees. They were loose, not strict, about the Law. Here is the evidence:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The Dead Sea Scrolls (250-50 B.C.) speak comparably to what Jesus said about the flaws in the Pharisees' doctrine on the Law which meant they were heading to damnation. The DSS say the Pharisees were "<strong><em>smooth interpreters</em></strong>" of the Law. Horsley says this means the Pharisees' rulings "were <strong><em>l</em></strong><strong><em>ax and liberal</em></strong>" on how to interpret the Law. He says this is ironic, because the DSS give "quite a different picture from the <em><strong>Christian traditional stereotype</strong></em> of [the Pharisees] as <strong><em>strict legalists</em></strong>." (Richard A. Horsley,<em> Hearing the Whole Story: The Politics of Plot in Mark's Gospel</em> (Westminster John Knox Press, 2001) 153.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Jesus's view of the Pharisees as anti-legalists is also confirmed by Josephus -- a Jewish scholar -- in his work<em> Antiquities of the Jews</em> (78 A.D.) For Josephus in 78 A.D. will explain there were two primary parties in Judaism in Jesus' day. They were the Sadducees and Pharisees. He will explain the Sadducees taught strict obedience to the Law. The Sadducees rejected the Pharisees precisely for their opposite approach on the Law of Moses. They believed the Pharisees supplanted the Law of Moses with mere traditions of the Pharisees. The Pharisees were negating the Law of Moses by their traditions.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=474017"></a>Here is Josephus, the First Century Jewish historian, identifying what divided these two parties:</span></p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">What I would now explain is this, that the Pharisees have delivered to the people a great many observances by succession from their fathers, which are&nbsp;<em><strong>not written in the Law of Moses</strong></em>; and it is for this reason that the<em><strong>Sadducees reject them</strong></em>, and say we are to esteem those&nbsp;<em><strong>observances that are in the written word</strong></em>, but are&nbsp;<strong><em>not to observe what are derived from the tradition of our forefathers</em></strong>. (Josephus Flavius,&nbsp;<em>Antiquities of the Jews</em> 13.10.6 (13.297)(Whiston translation (1841) at 360.)</span></p>
<p class="Quote"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Chaplain and Bishop Jeremy Taylor (1613-1667) said this variance in doctrine between the two sects is why Jesus in Matthew 5:20 says our righteousness must exceed that of the Pharisees rather than that of the Sadducees. In this verse, "Christ does not name the Sadducees, but the Scribes and the Pharisees." Jeremy traces this back to the shallow doctrine of the Pharisees, for they (not the Sadducees) would "<em><strong>add words of their own</strong></em>" to the Law, but the Sadducees "would <strong><em>admit of no suppletory traditions</em></strong>." (Jeremy Taylor, "Sermon 1: Righteousness Evangelical," <em>Discourses on Various Subjects</em> (Boston: 1816) at III:10.)</span></p>
<p class="Quote"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">This is why Jesus exhorted us to exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees: it was shallow. The Sadducees alone were on the right track in terms of the Law. Hence, E.P. Sanders was wrong to rely upon Paul's views of the Pharisees to reject as inauthentic Matthew 23:23. Rather, Paul turns out to have described to a crowd / Gentiles incorrectly what it meant to be a Pharisee. I don't suppose Paul was lying, but instead, he suffered from a belief that the self-righteousness of Pharisees as Jesus depicted them was indeed appropriate righteousness when the 'Law' was in effect.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Least in the Kingdom" Reference to John the Baptist</span></strong></h2>
<p class="Quote"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Some argue that it is not so bad to be called "least in the kingdom of heaven" as Jesus calls the law-loosener in Matt 5:17-19. This is because in Matt 11:11 Jesus supposedly makes the same reference to John the Baptist.</span></p>
<p class="Quote"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">However, Jesus does not do so. It is an English mistranslation. And the expression is not "least in the kingdom" in Matt 5:17-19, but rather are "called least by those in the kindgom of heaven," implying the exclusion of the "least" man in Matt 5:17-19. However, in Matthew 11:11, it is clear that the one involved is actually IN the Kingdom of Heaven.</span></p>
<p class="Quote"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">So let's read <a href="http://bible.cc/matthew/11-11.htm">Matt 11:11</a> in the NIV form:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" class="Quote"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span></p>
<p class="Quote"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The word rendered "least" in 11:11 does not mean that at all. It is a comparison term -- <em>mikroteros</em>, and means <em>less</em>. The word rendered "least" in Matt 5:19 is the superlative form, and is <em>elaxistos. </em>There is thus a world of difference between <em>less</em> and <em>least</em>, but in English the same word was used in both cases where only in Matt 5:19 is it appropriate. (See this<a href="http://www.torahresource.com/EnglishArticles/Matthew%205.17-20.pdf"> link</a> at 11.) So Matt 11:11 should be rendered:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" class="Quote"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is<strong><em> less</em></strong> in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span></p>
<p class="Quote"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, there is no parallelism in the original Greek. It is solely born of English mistranstranslation, whether unintentional or not does not matter.</span></p>

<div><strong>J. Jan. 10, 2011's Lengthy Letter</strong>:</div>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Wow, this is impressive! &nbsp;I knew that “Paul” meant “small” but somehow the connection between “small” and “least” just never registered until I saw the word jump out at me in your message below. &nbsp;It’s like it’s one of those things that is hidden in plain view. &nbsp;Amazing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">When I consider 1 Cor. 15:9 after reading your comments, it really shows just how extremely clever and crafty he was (trying to diffuse the meaning of his name ahead of time). &nbsp;I also found your comments on the word itself (“least”) very interesting, because while I have considered that those who do not keep Torah are lost, the “least” statement puzzled me as to why it seemed to soften the blow. &nbsp;It makes perfect sense that it would be those IN the Kingdom who would be calling those lawbreakers “least.” &nbsp;This is another one of those things hidden in plain sight. &nbsp;Wow. &nbsp;You really nailed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">You also answered my question about his name in your final paragraph (thank you!) as to whether or not the name “Paul” was really eligible to be considered as descriptive of him since we also know his name was Sha’ul. &nbsp;I did not know that Paul was anything more than just a nickname. &nbsp;That is pretty much the last nail in the coffin on this topic for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Good job, and thank you SO much for keeping me on your mailing list. I can almost see your excitement in sending this out after burning midnight oil!&nbsp;Shalom.</span></p>

<div><hr /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">As always, I find Doug's research and artilce thought provoking. &nbsp;I would like to point out too that even the name /character "Saul" is associated with "least." &nbsp;Check out 1 Samuel 9:21 and 1 Samuel 15:17. And interestingly enough King Saul losses his "Kingdom" because he didn't follow God's word. &nbsp;Perhaps another parallel? &nbsp;On a final note however, I can't say that I am convinced that all Paul believing/following Christians are lost. &nbsp;But thanks for the work Doug!!! (George Jan. 16, 2011)</span></div>
<div><hr /></div>
<div><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>My Reply</strong>. I do not believe "all Paul believing / following Christians are lost." I went back and revised the article to make that clear. I only believe what Jesus says. That those following the Pharisees loosened-law principles will not enter the kingdom if they do not do better than those law-looseners. (Matt. 5:20.) It is very much up to whether they "do the will of God" or not. That goes for all of us, as much as them. But because of Paul as their teacher, they have little chance to do so until they overcome the obstacle Paul represents to hearing and obeying the Law. Remember as to Gentiles, the scope of the Law is limited to commands that sojourners/foreigners followed, principally the Ten Commandments and most of Leviticus 17-22. Only Israelites had to be circumcised under the Law; Gentiles were exempt unless they wish to celebrate passover or enter the Temple at Jerusalem.
