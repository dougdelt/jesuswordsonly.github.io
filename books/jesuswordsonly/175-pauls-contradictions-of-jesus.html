<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Here is a list of the major contradictions by Paul of things Jesus taught. Some of this was mentioned by others, so when applicable I quote and reference the source who mentioned this. This list is as of March 2013. Come back for updates as I continue to add to this list. Please send me any that you have discovered.</span></p>
<h1>Jesus Says Not To Eat Meat Sacrificed to Idols, But Paul Says It Is Ok</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Three times Jesus in the Book of Revelation condemns eating meat sacrificed to idols, even saying this is the doctrine of a false prophet. (Rev.<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%202:6&amp;version=NIV"> 2:6</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%202:14&amp;version=NIV">14</a> (Ephesus);&nbsp;Rev. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%202:14&amp;version=NIV">2:14</a>-15 (Pergamum);&nbsp;Revelation <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%202:20&amp;version=NIV">2:20</a> (Thyatira).)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This absolute prescription also was set forth in James' ruling at the&nbsp;Jerusalem Council in Acts <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2015:20&amp;version=NIV">15:20</a>. Then it is repeated when it was put in a letter.&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2015:29&amp;version=NIV">Acts 15:29</a>.) Finally, James reiterates this for a third and final time in Acts chapter 21. James tells Paul that many claim Paul is teaching lawless doctrine. So James reminds Paul what was the ruling at the Jerusalem Council. He tells Paul that previously "we wrote giving judgment that they [<em>i.e</em>., the Gentiles] should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols...." (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2021:25&amp;version=NIV">Acts 21:25</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">However, Paul clearly teaches three times that there is nothing wrong in itself eating meat sacrificed to idols. (Romans <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014:21&amp;version=NIV">14:21</a>;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%208:4-13&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 8:4-13</a>, and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2010:19-29&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 10:19-29</a>.) The first time Paul addresses the question of "eating meat sacrificed to idols," Paul answers: "But food will not commend us to God; neither if we eat not...." (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%208:8-9&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 8:8</a>.) Paul then explained it is only necessary to abstain from eating such meat if you are around a "weaker" brother who thinks an idol is something. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%208:7&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 8:7</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%208:10&amp;version=NIV">8:10</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%209:22&amp;version=NIV">9:22</a>.) Then, and only then, must you abstain. The reason is that then a brother might be emboldened to do something he thinks is sinful. The brother is weak for believing eating meat sacrificed to an idol is wrong. This is thus a sin for him to eat, even though you know it is not sinful to eat meat sacrificed to idols. Thus, even though you know better than your weaker brother that it is no sin to do so, it is better to abstain in his presence than cause him to sin against his weak conscience and be "destroyed." (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%208:11&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 8:11</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">As <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Wikipedia</em> </span>says:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">A major controversy among&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Early Christians" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Christians">Early Christians</a> concerned whether it was permissible to eat meat that had been offered in pagan worship, see also&nbsp;<a title="Council of Jerusalem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Jerusalem">Council of Jerusalem</a>.&nbsp;<a title="Paul of Tarsus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_of_Tarsus">Paul of Tarsus</a>, who agreed to the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Apostolic Decree" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Decree">Apostolic Decree</a>, also wrote that<strong><em> it was permitted to do so</em></strong>, as long as a blessing was pronounced over it, and provided that&nbsp;<a title="Scandal (theology)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandal_(theology)">scandal</a> was not caused by it. ("<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolatry_and_Christianity">Idolatry and Christianity</a>," <em>Wikipedia</em>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">For more discussion, see Chapter Six of Jesus Words Only, available at this <a href="/JWO/chapter-six-jwo.html">link</a> to an html page.</span></p>

<h1><strong>Jesus Says The Law Continues, But Paul Says No</strong></h1>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>CAVEAT</strong>: The Law given Moses applicable to "foreigners/sojourners" (Gentiles) is a relatively small set of moral commands primarily from Leviticus, incorporating most of the Ten Commandments. So if the Law given Moses applies to Gentiles, it is not a burdensome list. Yet, we are still applying literally the Law, just as James did in Acts 15, by treating the term "foreigner/sojourners" versus "Israel" as literally as possible. This distinction perfectly explains why James said circumcision does not apply to Gentiles, <em>i.e.</em>, Leviticus <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus%2012:1-3&amp;version=KJV">12:1-3</a> only requires sons of "Israel" to be circumcised.&nbsp;See this <a href="/books/jesuswordsonly/98-law-applicable-today.html">webpage</a> where we discuss this issue in more depth.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Jesus's View on the Law</strong>. Jesus emphasized the validity of the Law up through the passing away of Heaven and Earth, thus confirming its inspiration and ongoing validity. In Matthew <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:17-19&amp;version=ASV">5:17-19</a> we read:</span></p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">(17) Think not that I came to destroy<em><strong> the Law [of Moses] </strong></em>or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil. (18) For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in&nbsp;<strong><em>no wise pass away from the Law</em></strong>, till all things be accomplished [<em>i.e.</em>, all things predicted appear on the stage of history].&nbsp;(19) Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and<em> <strong>shall teach men so</strong></em><strong>,</strong> shall be called&nbsp;<strong><em>least</em></strong> in the kingdom of heaven: but&nbsp;<strong><em>whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great </em></strong>in the kingdom of heaven. (ASV)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Compare Luke 16:17 similarly says at a different time than the Sermon on the Mount -- meaning Jesus repeated the same point twice:</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"> "<sup class="versenum" style="color: #494a44; font-family: 'times new roman', times; line-height: 21px; font-size: 0.75em; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;</sup>It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law. (Luke<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+16&amp;version=NIV" style="color: #517291; text-decoration: underline; font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium; line-height: 21px;">&nbsp;16:16</a>-17 NIV.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Thus, Jesus can never be accused of seducing any Christian from following the Law. Jesus cannot be a false prophet under&nbsp;Deuteronomy <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy%2013:5&amp;version=KJV">13:5</a> (false prophet is anyone who has miracles and wonders but seduces you from following the Law). Jesus said the Law remained valid until the Heavens and Earth pass away. This passing of heaven and earth occurs at the end of the Millennium. This is 1000 years after Christ's Second Coming, according to the Book of Revelation.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Paul's View on the Law</strong>. Paul says the opposite.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul is blunt in Ephesians 2:15, Colossians 2:14, 2 Cor. 3:11-17, Romans<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom.%207:13&amp;version=ASV"> 7:1-3</a> et seq, and Galatians 3:19 et seq. The Law is "abolished," "done away with," "nailed to a tree," "has faded away,' and was "only ordained by angels...who are no gods." If we were to cite Paul's condemnations of the Law in one string, the point is self-evident that Paul abrogated the Law for everyone. See Eph. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph.%202:15&amp;version=NIV">2:15</a> ("setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations"); Col. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col.%202:14&amp;version=ASV">2:14</a> ("having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us: and he hath taken it out that way, nailing it to the cross;")&nbsp;2 Cor. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20cor.%203:14&amp;version=ASV">3:14</a> ("old covenant"); Gal.<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gal.%205:1&amp;version=ASV"> 5:1</a> ("yoke of bondage"); Rom. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom.%2010:4&amp;version=ASV">10:4</a> ("Christ is <em><strong>the end of the law</strong></em>"); 2 Cor. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20cor.%203:7&amp;version=ASV">3:7</a> ("law of death"); Gal. 5:1 ("entangles"); Col. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col.%202:14-17&amp;version=ASV">2:14-17</a> ("a shadow"); Rom. 3:27 ("law of works"); Rom. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%204:15&amp;version=NIV">4:15</a> ("works wrath"); 2 Cor.<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20cor.%203:9&amp;version=ASV"> 3:9</a> (ministration of condemnation); Gal. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gal.%202:16&amp;version=NIV">2:16</a> ("cannot justify"); Gal. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gal.%203:21&amp;version=NIV">3:21</a> (cannot give life); Col. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col.%202:14-17&amp;version=ASV">2:14</a> ("<em><strong>wiped out</strong></em>" exaleipsas); Gal. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23:1-15&amp;version=NIV">3:19</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gal.%204:8-9&amp;version=NIV">4:8-9</a> ("given by angels...who are no gods [and are] weak and beggarly celestial beings/elements").</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Finally, in Romans<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A1-6&amp;version=NKJV"> 7:1-6</a>, Paul claims when Jesus died, the husband died and this dissolved the Law's bonds between the husband (God of Sinai) and wife (God's people). This henceforth made the "law dead to us." (Romans <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207:4&amp;version=NKJV">7:4</a>.) This death-of-God-the-husband released the Jews, Paul contends, and when Christ resurrected the bonds of marriage with the old God were not renewed. &nbsp;(The implication, we contend, was Paul meant a new God emerges or otherwise if the same husband-God resurrected, why wasn't the bond to the Law renewed? Paulinists come near to admitting this is the only <em>logical</em> meaning while even confessing they are uncomfortable with the passage's 'seemingly' polytheistic explanation... Uggh. On our thorough analysis of Romans 7:1-6, see our&nbsp;<a href="/books/jesuswordsonly/167-romans-7-a-major-incongruity.html">webpage</a> discussion.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">For more discussion on Paul's abrogation of the Law, see chapter five of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Jesus Words Only</em></span> excerpted at this<a href="/JWO/chapter-five-jwo.html"> link</a>.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">How do those devoted to every word from both Paul and Jesus resolve the contradiction? Here is a perfect example:</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">If [Jesus] is saying [in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A17&amp;version=NIV">Matt 5:17</a> by saying He fulfilled the Law, and meant] he is the 'end of the Law' [as Paul taught in Romans 10:4], then why does he say in the next verse that the Law will never disappear? ...There is something exasperating about trying to understand a verse like this....What the verse seems to say<strong><em> contradicts what we know from other verses in the New Testament</em></strong>. The truth is <strong><em>we cannot be expected to understand this vers</em></strong>e.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Bivin, David. Blizzard, Jr., Roy.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em> Understanding the Difficult Words of Jesus: New Insights From A Hebraic Perspective</em></span> (Destiny Image, 2001) at 113.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Incidentally, Bivin-Blizzard offer a Hebrew approach that Jesus' means by saying he did not come to destroy the Law means his interpretations will not weaken its meaning, and <em>to fulfill</em> means to make it more lasting. Even with that, Bivin-Blizzard realize they haven't removed the contradiction between Paul and Jesus.</span></p>
<hr />
<h1>Paul Says The Pharisees Followed The Law Rigorously, But Jesus Says They Were Lax About The Law</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul says in Philippians <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians%203:5-6&amp;version=KJV">3:5-6</a> that as a result of his time as a Pharisee that "as touching righteousness,&nbsp;<strong><em>found blameless</em></strong>." Cf. Acts <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2026:5&amp;version=NIV">26:5</a> where Paul says "I conformed to the strictest sect of our religion, living as a Pharisee."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Of course, Jesus taught contrarily that the Pharisees were lax in teaching and obeying the Law. See Matt. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2023:23&amp;version=KJV">23:23</a>.&nbsp;<em>See also</em>, Matt. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2015:6,9&amp;version=KJV">15: 6,9.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This contradiction between Paul and Jesus has probably had the most important impact on doctrine. By perceiving the Pharisees through Paul's eyes, we are led to believe Jesus condemned the Pharisees as legalists -- Paul's view. However, Jesus condemned the Pharisees as<em><strong> ANTI-LEGALISTS</strong></em>. Jesus condemned them as teachers abrogating the Law by their man-made ordinances. (Matt. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2015:6,9&amp;version=KJV">15:6</a>). And Jesus condemned them as those who taught the lesser commands of the Law while ignoring the more weightier commands of the Law. (Matt. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2023:23&amp;version=KJV">23:23</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hence, a wrong deduction is achieved by using Paul's contradictory perception of the Pharisees. Paul says the Pharisees are<strong><em> legalists</em></strong>; but Jesus says they are <em><strong>anti-legalists</strong></em>. These are <strong>radically opposite perceptions</strong>. If Paul's view were correct, then Jesus impliedly condemned obedience any longer to the Law by criticizing the Pharisees. However, if Jesus's view of the Pharisees as lax about the Law is correct (and who can deny our Lord's veracity!), then Jesus condemned any teaching that either marginalized the Law or contradicted the Law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This fits precisely into Jesus's statement:&nbsp;"he that teaches and keeps the Law of Moses <em><strong>will be great</strong></em> in the kingdom of heaven." (Matt.<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%205:19&amp;version=KJV"> 5:19</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">However, because Paul depicts the Pharisees - enemies of Jesus - as law-keepers, Paul is understood to be "condemning all who are zealous of the Law of Moses as an enemy of Messiah." (Cosette,&nbsp;<em>Id.</em>, at 21.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This means Paul indirectly<strong><em> condemned our Lord Jesus Christ</em></strong> when Paul condemned those who were teaching the Law should be followed, both big and little commands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>CAVEAT</strong>: Please note that I have explained that the Law does not have but a relatively modest number of provisions that apply to non-Israelites/sojouners. It has provisions that specifically extend rules to sojourners/non-Israelites who join with the community.&nbsp;See this&nbsp;<a href="/books/jesuswordsonly/98-law-applicable-today.html">webpage</a> where we discuss this issue.</span></p>

<h1><strong>Jesus Says Only God Is Your Spiritual Father, and Call No Man on Earth Your Father, But Paul Says He Is The Corinthians' Only Spiritual Father</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus said:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">and ye may not call [any] your father on the earth, for<strong><em> one is your Fathe</em></strong><strong><em>r</em></strong>, who is in the heavens, (Matt. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2023:9&amp;version=YLT">23:9</a> YLT)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">But Paul says:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">For even if you had ten thousand others to teach you about Christ, you have<strong><em> only one spiritual father</em></strong>. For <em><strong>I became your father</strong></em> in Christ Jesus when I preached the Good News to you. (<a href="http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Cor. 4:15</a>, NLT)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Incidentally,&nbsp;based on Paul, the Roman Catholic Church has countenanced the direct violation of our Lord’s words in calling a priest ‘father.’ See “Call No Man Father: Understanding Matthew 23:9,” <a href="http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0089.html">http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0089.html</a> (accessed 2010).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Furthermore, Jesus' likely primary point was He intended people to stop venerating Abraham, calling him "Father Abraham" in place of "Our Father" in heaven. Jesus makes this subtle point in a parable about one in hell who called out to "Father Abraham" in a prayer rather than to God Himself. (<a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-24.htm">Luke 16:24</a>.) In that light, then it is significant Paul violates Jesus' words a second time when Paul refers to "Abraham is the father of us all." (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:16&amp;version=ASV">Romans 4:16</a>.) Only "Our Father" in heaven is the "father of us all." To exalt Abraham to that level, Jesus intended us to understand, is idolatry - putting Abraham on the same level as God.&nbsp;Jesus wants to call no one father in that venerating sense. Paul invited such spiritual veneration of himself as the spiritual "father" of the Corinthians -- all in contradiction to Christ's words.</span></p>

<h1><hr />Jesus Says Salvation Initiates And Continues By Repentance From Sin and Obedience Besides Faith; Paul Says This is Heresy</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul's main&nbsp;salvation verses&nbsp;<em>at odds </em>with Jesus are well-known:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="Bulleted"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><a href="http://bible.cc/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a> ("man is justified by faith apart from observing the law").</span></li>

</ul>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Here where it matters most, Paul has a different voice than our Lord Jesus. Paul's themes are alien to Jesus's message of salvation. They undercut, if not destroy, the message of Jesus. The true sheep of Jesus recognize His voice, and will not follow another.

This interpreted Paul as saying our salvation initiates by faith, but is maintained by works, including repentance.

For a very good defense of this notion, using Paul's present v. past tense reference to saved, see this<a href="http://www.christian-history.org/not-by-faith-alone.html"> webpage</a> from Christian History.org. However, Jesus says salvation initiates, such as for the Prodigal, by repentance from sin combined with faith in the father, while Paul contrarily says that it initiates by faith alone without a hint of any repentance from sin.</span></p>

<h1>Jesus Tells Apostles To Teach His Commands Given Prior to His Ascension While In The Flesh, But Paul Says Not To Do So (Per Bultmann's Reading)</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">After the Risen Lord proved He had the same nail holes as He had on the cross, Jesus' final words just before He ascended into heaven were that the then Apostles should teach "<strong><em>everything that I commanded you</em></strong>...." Matt. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt.%2028:20&amp;version=NIV">28:20</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus must have meant to teach all His commands prior to the Cross, and not simply any given after He rose from the dead and prior to Ascension. How do we know that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The reason we know this is true is because none of the four gospels contain any post-cross commands. If Jesus meant by His command to teach the world "all that I have commanded you" (Matt. 28:20) to teach only His commands <strong><em>post-resurrection</em></strong>, the four gospels would have contained such commands. However, there are none quoted except the command in Matt. 28:20 to teach Jesus'commands previously given. Hence, Jesus clearly meant by "everything I commanded you" to be His words in His earthly ministry <strong><em>before His resurrection</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hence, Jesus could only have meant that post-Ascension the apostles were to teach the <strong><em>pre-Cross teachings of Jesus</em></strong> -- while He was clearly "in the flesh."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">However, Paul's statement in 2 Corinthians 5:16 is interpreted to justify rejecting this.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><sup>16</sup>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though <em><strong>we have known Christ after the flesh</strong></em>, yet now <strong><em>henceforth know we him no more</em></strong>. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:16-17&amp;version=KJV">KJV</a>)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The famous and influential evangelical theologian Rudolf Bultmann said 2 Corinthians 5:16 means we no longer know Christ in the flesh,&nbsp;<em>i.e.</em>, we supposedly can dispense with Jesus's teachings when He was in the flesh. Paul tells us that only the messages Paul received from the resurrected Christ -- who supposedly no longer had flesh -- is the means to know Christ any longer. Indeed, Origen and Clement in the early church read "in the flesh" in 2 Cor. 5:16 to mean the period of Christ's earthly preaching. (See our discussion at this&nbsp;<a href="/JWO/2-corinthians-516.html">link</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Read this way by Bultmann, Paul tells us we no longer know or need to know Jesus' message delivered pre-Resurrection when He was in the flesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This is also how the Christian theologian and physician&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer">Albert Schweitzer</a> (1875-1965) viewed 2 Cor. 5:16 in his book of 1911&nbsp;<a href="http://archive.org/details/MN41519ucmf_2"><em>Geschichte Der Paulinischen Forschung </em></a>(J. C. B. Mohr) [Archive.org] at 191 (and in English translation,&nbsp;<a href="http://archive.org/details/paulandhisinterp00schwuoft"><em>Paul and His Interpreters: </em><em>The conception of authority in the Pauline writings</em> (1918) at 36</a>.) Schweitzer explained: "since the death and resurrection of the Lord [Paul believed] conditions were present that were so <strong><em>wholly new</em></strong> that they <em><strong>made his [Jesus's] teaching inapplicable</strong></em><em>.</em>" (<em>Id</em>.) Thus, Albert Schweitzer says this is what explains Paul's failure to mention any significant teachings of Jesus: "If we had only St Paul to guide us, we should not know that Jesus spoke in&nbsp;parables, that He spoke the Sermon on the Mount and taught His people the Lord's Prayer."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Indeed, with the sole exception of the eucharistic formula at 1 Cor 11:24-25, Paul does not quote any sayings of the historical Jesus as found in the written Gospels. Furthermore, Paul never even once alludes to the panorama of the Savior's life story from the Nativity up to the Passion, as well as Jesus's elaborate teaching, which fill the pages of the first four books of the New Testament.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">By contrast, and astonishingly, at Acts 13:<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2013:24-25&amp;version=NIV">24-25</a> Paul does quote <em>John the Baptist from the written gospels</em>! &nbsp;And the Jesus of Paul quotes Greek works more frequently than Jesus's words from the gospels. See our article <a href="/books/jesuswordsonly/300-pagan-influences-in-writings-of-paul.html">Pagan Influences on Pau</a>l. Hence, Paul was&nbsp;a well-read man but never thought Christ's teachings in the flesh which we find in the gospels were of any importance to relate to the Romans, Corinthians, Ephesians, Thessalonians, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">As a result, Bultmann saw things the same way as did Albert Schweitzer. As one commentator on Bultmann summarized his influential view of 2 Corinthians 5:16, Paul deliberately ignored Jesus' teachings during His earthly ministry because Paul discovered a new and different preaching than what Christ taught pre-resurrection. This rendered supposedly defunct that prior message of Jesus:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Bultmann...regards the <em>historical Jesus as irrelevant</em> as to the <em>kerygma</em> [<em>i.e.</em>, preaching]&nbsp;of the risen Lord whom Paul proclaimed. Bultmann understood 2 Corinthians 5:16 ("even though<em> we once knew Christ</em> <em>kata sarka </em>[through/by<em> means of the flesh</em>], we<em> know him thus no longer</em>") to mean that <em>Paul chose not to employ his knowledge of Jesus kerygmatically</em> [<em>i.e.</em>, for preaching], a view with which Bultmann agreed [with Paul.]. Accordingly, the influential scholar of Marburg [<em>i.e.</em>, Bultmann] declared Paul the "founder of Christian theology." (Paul Barnett, <em>Paul: Missionary of Jesus</em> (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2008)&nbsp;at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=J7tnFxRTlbYC&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Bultmann%20Theology%20of%20Paul%20irrelevant%20jesus&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=Bultmann%20Theology%20of%20Paul%20irrelevant%20jesus&amp;f=false">13</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hence, Paul is viewed to instruct us no longer to teach Jesus' teachings while Jesus was in the flesh, i.e., from His earthly ministry (2 Cor. 5:16). But Jesus commanded to the contrary that we do so in Matthew 28:20. Hence, 2 Cor. 5:16 contradicts Matt. 28:20 as Paulinists construe 2 Cor. 5:16.</span></p>

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>Paul Says Elders Are Entitled To Pay for 'Preaching &amp; Teaching,' But Jesus Says No</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In 1 Tim. 5:17, Paul wrote: "The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching." Then Paul uses a verse about not muzzling an ox in an odd extension to imply churchgoers have a duty to pay the elders for their service. (1 Tim. 5:18.) Elsewhere, Paul says:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">14 In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel <em><strong>should receive their living from the gospel</strong></em>.&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+9%3A14&amp;version=NIV">1 Cor. 9:14 </a>NIV.)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">But I thought Jesus said to His disciples to lay no cost on anyone they served by preaching and healing? "Without cost you have received; <strong><em>without cost you are to give</em></strong>." (Matt. <a href="http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/matthew/matthew10.htm" style="font-weight: bold;">10:8</a>, NAB.) Jesus in the prior verse was commanding the apostles to go out and preach the gospel, so the context makes quite clear that <em><strong>no charge was to be made on auditors to hear preaching of the gospel or healing ministries</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Hence, 1 Tim. 5:17-18 and 1 Cor. 9:14 contradicts Jesus in Matthew 10:8.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Incidentally compare: Micah 3:11 WEB which says similarly to what Jesus says:</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="margin-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">11 Her leaders judge for bribes,</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">and<strong><em> her priests teach for a price</em></strong>,</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">and her <em><strong>prophets of it tell fortunes for money</strong></em>:</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">yet they lean on Yahweh, and say,</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">“Isn’t Yahweh in the midst of us?</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">No disaster will come on us.”</span></p>
<hr style="font-weight: bold;" />
<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Jesus Teaches There Are Only 12 Apostles Into Eternity, But Paul Adds Himself To The List As a Thirteenth</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Matthias was voted to replace Judas in Acts 1, with the Holy Spirit deciding between two candidates. Hence, the 12 were established long before Paul became a Christian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">However, our Savior made the permanent tally of the Apostles established at exactly twelve --- for obvious reasons of historical symbolism. One can see the historical symmetry at Rev 21:12-14. Twelve apostles to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul was never&nbsp;numbered in that circle; not even Barnabas in his Epistle recognizes Paul’s Apostleship!: "[The Apostles] to whom he gave the power of the Gospel to preach; and<em> there are twelve as a testimony to the tribes</em>, because there are<strong><em> twelve tribes </em></strong>of Israel." (Epistle of Barnabas<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/barnabas.html"> 8:3</a>).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">However, Paul repetitiously claimed he was an apostle. Yet, not once did Jesus ever call Paul an apostle, even by Luke's quotations taken form Paul's claims to his encounter with Jesus. Read for yourself Paul's vision accounts in Acts 9, 22 and 26<strong>. In these accounts, the Jesus whom Paul met said Paul would be a <em>martus</em>. </strong>That means "<strong>witness</strong>," not "apostolos" (messenger).</span></p>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold;"><hr /></h3>
<h1 style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>Paul Exhorts Celibacy, But Jesus Clearly Says It is A Choice Not Within Everyone's Power</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul taught against being married. He wrote in 1 Cor. 10:27-28:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"Are you bound to a wife? &nbsp;Do not seek to be free. &nbsp;Are you <em>free from a wife</em>? <strong> Do </strong><em><strong>not seek marriage</strong></em>. &nbsp;But if you marry, you do not sin, and if a girl marries she does not sin."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In line with this Paul also wrote:</span></p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"I wish all were as I am," meaning unmarried. (1 Cor. 7:7.)</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">To help prevent the desire to be married, Paul said: ‘It is good that a man should not touch a woman.’ (1 Cor. 7:1.)</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"> If Paul is a true prophet and wishes something, such as avoiding touching a woman and to not "seek to be married," then Paul clearly endorses celibacy for us too as a superior way of life.</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">However, Jesus speaks differently of celibacy as something for some but not all disciples. It is not a command or even an exhortation. It is merely a legitimate option. "He who is able to receive this, let him receive it." Matt. 19:12.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The contradiction arises because Jesus never says or implies "do not seek marriage." Significantly, Jesus never applies any moral suasion or pressure to be celibate, while Paul clearly does so.</span></p>

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Jesus Says There Is One Pastor and Teacher (Himself), But Paul Says There Are Many Pastors and Teachers</h1>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus said there is One Pastor and One Teacher:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And I have other sheep, that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock, <em><strong>one shepherd/pastor</strong></em> (Grk <em>poimen</em>)&nbsp;(John 10:16.)</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="p3"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"But be not ye called Rabbi: for <em>one is your teacher</em>, and all ye are brethren...." (Matt. <a href="http://bible.cc/matthew/23-8.htm">23:8</a>)(ASV)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">However, Paul says "And his gifts were that some should be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, <em><strong>some pastors</strong> </em>(shepherds, Greek <em>poimenas</em>) and <em><strong>teachers </strong></em><strong>(didaskolos)</strong>...." (Eph. 4:11.)</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul speaks of the "Lord of <em><em>the dead</em></em> and the living." (Romans 14:9.)&nbsp;But Jesus says "God is <em><em>not</em> </em>the God <em><em>of the dead</em></em> but the living." (Luke 20:38.)</span></p>
<hr style="font-weight: bold;" />
<h1 style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>Paul Says God Does Not Live in Temples Made of Human Hands, But Jesus Says He Does</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul says&nbsp;"God who made the world and everything in it is <strong><em>the Lord of heaven</em></strong> and earth and <em><strong>does not live in temples built by hands</strong></em>." (<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2017:24&amp;version=NIV">Acts 17:24</a>). However, Jesus said, in a correction of Pharisees who thought an oath offered "by" articles offered at the Temple were binding but not an oath by the Temple at Jerusalem itself: "And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by<em> <strong>the one who dwells in it</strong></em>." (Matt.<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2023:21&amp;version=NIV"> 23:21</a>.) Hence, Jesus's logic was that because the article of the Temple is less important than the Temple<em> where God dwells </em>at Jerusalem, an oath "by" the Temple is as binding as an oath by an article. The importance of this is Jesus affirms God does live in a temple made of human hands, but Paul says this is untrue. [Added 9/22/2010]</span></p>

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>Jesus says Nations Of The World Are Under Satan, But Paul Says Their Rulers Are Agents of God</strong></h1>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The celestial kingdom is described in the Gospels as of another order from the entire realm of the nations, which are ruled by Satan and whereby Christ was crucified.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">On the other hand, the secular authorities with all their weaponry (including Mk 15:16 ff) are stated by Paul to be God's own agents.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul also contradicts Hosea <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hosea%208:4&amp;version=NIV">8:4</a> (700s BC): "They set up kings without my consent;&nbsp;&nbsp;they choose princes without my approval."

<h2>Paul Excludes Eating With Sinners But Christ's Example We Are To Follow, and Lost Sheep Parable, Is Contrary</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In 1 Cor. 5:9, Paul clearly writes:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: 5:10 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. 5:11 But now I have written unto<em> you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with<strong> such an one no not to eat</strong></em>. 5:12 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? 5:13 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">What did Pharisees like Paul say was Jesus' sin or error?<strong><em> Eating with sinners.</em></strong>&nbsp;In <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?&amp;search=Luke+15">Luke 15:1</a>, the Pharisees accused Jesus of error, saying: "This man receives sinners and <strong><em>eats with them</em></strong>." Then Jesus defends this in a Parable of the Lost Sheep -- that if you have a lost sheep, you don't wait for it to come home, but you go out to where you can find it, and then take it home. Jesus defends proactively socializing with sinners so as to bring them home as lost sheep.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Now the tax collectors<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span>&nbsp;and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus.</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">2&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and <em><strong>eats with them</strong></em>.”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">3&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus told them this parable:<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span></span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">4&nbsp;</span>“Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. <em><strong>Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it</strong></em>?<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span></span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">5&nbsp;</span>And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">6&nbsp;</span>and goes home.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In another context, Jesus gives a similar defense when the Pharisees similarly accused Jesus of the alleged error of eating and socializing with sinners:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">5&nbsp;</span>While Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">16&nbsp;</span>When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"></span>&nbsp;saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: “<strong><em>Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners</em></strong>?”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">17&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">On hearing this, Jesus said to them,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">“It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+2%3A15-17&amp;version=NIV">Mark 2:15-17</a> NIV.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Jesus defended the practice of making an effort to socialize with sinners to bring them back from a lost condition to a saved one. For the "healthy" don't need a doctor to call upon them -- only the sick (sinners in context).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">But Paul says the opposite. Don't "eat" with sinners, Paul clearly says. Hence, 1 Cor. 5:9 contradicts Jesus's clear practice of eating with sinners. This is akin to Paul's idea of "turning" people over to Satan, abandoning them and praying Satan takes control of their lives. Jesus says this is an error -- Jesus instead says you seek to turn such people from Satan and back to God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The only argument that Jesus agrees with Paul comes from Jesus' direction that within the church, we were to confront brothers / sisters with sins against us, and only after this process is taken in two unsuccessful steps, then you should treat the sinner as a tax collector / sinner. See Matt. 18. Yet, it is not clear that this means not eating with them, as Jesus made a point to eat with tax collectors and sinners. Treating someone as a tax collector apparently meant treating them differently. This could be to not give them greetings of shalom or visiting them in their home as John speaks in his epistle that we should not take certain heretics into our home. Jesus' instructions to treat someone as a "sinner" does not necessarily mean not eating with them. In light of Jesus' practice of eating with sinners, we should not construe it to prohibit doing so.&nbsp;</span></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Paul Teaches In Original Sin But Jesus Contradicts</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Truth Seekers explains:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul has managed to contradict Jesus in almost every single area of faith and practice. Jesus says that there is no original sin (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A13-16&amp;version=NIV">Mark 10:13-14</a>) while Paul says there is (Rom. 5:12-14).&nbsp;("<a href="http://www.truthseekers.co.za/content/view/87/53/">Can Paul Be Trusted</a>")</span></p>

<h2>Jesus' Command About Callling Anyone Fool Is Violated by Paul</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Truth Seekers argues:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">If you think you are wise by this world's standards, you will have to become a fool so you can become wise by God's standards.” – I Corinthians 3:18 (NLT).&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">[T]hese statements... contradict Jesus who said: “Whosoever shall say, Thou fool , shall be in danger of hell fire” (Mathew 5:22). According to Jesus, calling someone a fool may make you worthy of Hell yet becoming a fool is a prerequisite of faith according to Paul! Also see Romans 1:22 where<strong> Paul calls the Romans “fools.”</strong> ("<a href="http://www.truthseekers.co.za/content/view/87/53/">Can Paul Be Trusted</a>.")</span></p>

<h2>Who Should We Follow/Imitate? Paul? or Jesus?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Peter tells us to imitate Christ. The author of Hebrews (Barnabas) likewise says Jesus is our example. But Paul says we are to imitate and follow himself. I am quoting here from "Church Myths -- Church of Christ or Paul" by an anonymous author:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In church do the sheep learn all about Jesus and what He instructs? Not as a rule. They are taught the gospel of Paul and not the gospel of Jesus. Well you may ask what is the difference. Well the main difference is that Jesus was God proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom. Jesus was to be our perfect example on how to live, yet Paul in his letters tells us how to live. Jesus told us to follow Him alone, yet Paul says 1Co 4:16 "Wherefore I beseech (beg) you, be ye followers of me." ...&nbsp;It is the Pope of Rome that instructs "his" church to be followers and imitators of himself. As a follower of Christ, I would NEVER tell some one to follow me. We follow Jesus only! Paul says,"Brothers, be imitators together of me, and mark those who walk this way, for you have us for a pattern." Phi 3:17&nbsp;(Church Myths - Church of Christ or Paul?

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">I am quoting here from "Church Myths -- Church of Christ or Paul" by an anonymous author:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">What Jesus taught and what Paul taught was two different things. Here is a few quick example. Jesus instructs us to feed the poor. Paul says, "For even when we were with you we gave you orders, saying, <em><strong>If any man does no work, let him not have food</strong></em>. For it has come to our ears that there are some among you whose behavior is uncontrolled, who do no work at all, but <strong><em>are over-interested in the business of others</em></strong>."2Th 3:10 Jesus said to feed the poor. He did not say feed the poor unless they are over interested in other people's business. This is what Paul does. He pontificates endless rules of conduct, yet from the other side of his mouth he says we are free in Christ?&nbsp;(Church Myths - Church of Christ or Paul?

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul paints a picture of us being free from the law because of Jesus' sacrifice. Nothing could be further from the truth. Jesus came to fulfill the law and to empower us with His Holy Spirit so that we can keep the law. Yet Paul says, "Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds (works) of the law." Rom 3:28 Elsewhere he states that God "...imputes righteousness without works." Rom 4:6 Paul is saying here that salvation is through faith alone and that we do not need works such as works repentance and works of righteousness. Jesus says, "And why do you call Me Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?" Luk 6:46&nbsp;(Church Myths - Church of Christ or Paul?

<h2>Paul Denies Obedience Grants Any Righteousness Unto Life, But Jesus Says It Does</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul says that&nbsp;"<em>if there HAD been a law given which&nbsp;<strong>could have</strong> given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law." (</em>Gal 3:21). This tells me that Paul believed that no such Law ever existed that could give eternal life. This is in direct contradiction with Jesus; "If you want to enter life, obey the commandments." (Mat 19:17) &nbsp;[Contributed by David B. 12/3/2011]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Saul preached that the law cannot justify or make man righteous before God:</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Ro 3:20 - Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Ro 4:15 - Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Ga 2:16 - Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Ga 3:11 - But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>In contrast, the Lord affirmed the law, came to fulfill his part in it, and exhorted his hearers to obey it. Thus:</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Mt 5:17 - Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Mt 7:12 - Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And the Lord added that, beyond or on top of the life that the law gives, he offers perfection to those who would follow him. Thus:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Mt 19:16 - And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? 17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. 18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, 19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? 21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>In summary, Paul’s gospel says:</strong> Never mind the law; just believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you are saved. Thus many believers disregard the Ten Commandments without feeling guilty, believing that they have been saved by faith in Christ, and that once saved, always saved. But if they cannot enter life, how can they go to perfection?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>But the Lord’s gospel says:</strong> Obey the law and enter life, then achieve perfection by following him. Faith in him makes easier entry to life and achievement of perfection, because the Holy Spirit puts and writes the law in our minds and hearts. But the Holy Spirit does not dwell in unclean vessels. The correct sequence therefore is: Repent, forgive, believe in Christ, be baptized, and the Holy Spirit will indwell us and lead us to life (by obeying the Law) and perfection (by following Christ in agape love).</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul quoted from Psalm 14 and used a tiny truncated phrase to make a huge generalization to set aside the Law. Fully read, Psalm 14 clearly states that while none is righteous among the fools and children of iniquity, God always has a righteous generation who keep the Law.

<h2><span style="font-size: x-large;">Extra Material: Paul's Contradictions of Yahweh in Original Testament</span></h2>
<h3><strong><span style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #3366ff;">God Will Not Justify Ungodly But Paul Says He Does</span></strong></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"I will <strong><em>not justify the ungodly</em></strong>." (Exodus <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2023:7&amp;version=KJV">23:7</a>, KJV, ASV.)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"He that <strong><em>justifieth the ungodly</em></strong> ...[is] <strong><em>an abomination</em></strong> to Yahweh." (Proverbs <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs%2017:15&amp;version=KJV">17:15</a>.)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">But Paul says:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on <em><strong>him that justifieth the ungodly</strong></em>, his faith is counted for righteousness." (Romans&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:4-5&amp;version=KJV">4:5</a>, KJV.)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">(Paul in context is relying upon a mistranslation of Genesis 15:6 from 257 BC in the Septuagint Greek translation. <a href="/books/jesuswordsonly/169-chapter-26-7jwo-genesis-156.html">Link</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In context, all mainstream scholars concur Paul means God justified Abraham before Abraham repented of unrighteousness. Unlike Exodus and Proverbs quoted above, Paul in Romans 4:3-6 intends us to understand that by faith alone, <em>i.e.</em>, believing God as did Abraham (which was that he would have a child through Sarah in his old age) while we are ungodly, we are justified. This is why all mainstream scholars say Paul taught justification <strong><em>without repentance from sin</em></strong>, but based upon faith alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">However, in Ezekiel we learn that only upon repentance including turning from evil did the ungodly receive life (<em>i.e.</em>, eternal life) and hence were justified.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><sup>14</sup>Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if<em><strong> he turn from his sin</strong></em>, and <strong><em>do that which is lawful and right</em></strong>;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><sup>15</sup>If the <strong><em>wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live</em></strong>, he shall not die.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><sup>16</sup>None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live. (Ezekiel <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel%2033:14-16&amp;version=KJV">33:14-16</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Likewise, Jesus teaches justification is solely by repentance from sin in the Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican. The one who went home "justified" is the one who beat his breast and asked God to be "merciful to me, a sinner," but the Pharisee (who believed in Yahweh) was smug that he had not sinned and went home unjustified. See Luke&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2018:9-14&amp;version=KJV">18:9-14</a>.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul Delivers A Slave Back to His Master, Contrary to Scripture</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">While in prison, Paul met a runaway slave, Onesimus, the property of a Christian -- presumably Philemon. Paul sent the slave back to his owner. This action is forbidden in Deuteronomy 23:15-16:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee."</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">"He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him."</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Rather than give the slave sanctuary, Paul returned him to his owner. Paul seems to hint that he would like Philemon to give Onesimus his freedom, but does not actually request it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;">Paul Says Jesus is An Image of God in Violation of First Commandment</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul in the same passage that he says Jesus is a created being -- "the first-born of creation" -- says Jesus is an "image of God." (Col. 2:15.) This is a violation of the first commandment which prohibits using a creature (as Paul viewed Jesus) as an image of God. See our <a href="/books/jesuswordsonly/322-paul-claims-jesus-is-the-image-of-god.html">webpage article</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large; font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;">Paul Says Rulers of This World Are God's Agents In Violation of Holy Scripture</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Not only does Paul contradict Jesus in this doctrine, Paul violates passages in the Original Testament. See our <a href="/books/jesuswordsonly/244-satans-domain-over-world-rulers.html">webpage</a>.</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-size: x-large;">Paul's Contradictions of Himself</span></h1>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">1. 'Resurrection At Baptism' - Oops! 'I Meant Resurrection Has Not Yet Happened!'</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul in 2 Timothy 2:18 condemns heretics who claim "The resurrection has already taken place."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">One commentator points out the heretics had reasonable support in the words of Paul for what Paul condemns in 2 Tim. 2:18:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Concerning the resurrection, Paul’s baptismal theology might be&nbsp;seen to imply that<em><strong> the believer has risen with Christ in baptism</strong></em> (Rom. 6; Col. 2). Concerning the&nbsp;body, Paul had said that <strong><em>flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God</em></strong> (1 Cor.15:50). In&nbsp;other words:<strong> could not the heretics attacked in the Pastorals claim Paul’s support for their&nbsp;doctrines?</strong> There is, in fact, a distinct possibility that they did so. (Oskar Skarsaune, “Heresy and the Pastoral Epistles,” <em>Themelios</em> 20.1 (October 1994): 9-14, at 10 available in PDF at this <a href="http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/heresy_skarsaune.pdf">link</a>.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Skarsaune cites in support several scholars who construct the arguments of condemned groups who relied upon Paul's words for this very doctrine that the resurrection of Christians already has happened:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Elaine Pagels, ‘“The mystery&nbsp;of the resurrection”: A Gnostic reading of 1 Corinthians 15’,<em> JBL</em> 93 (1974), pp. 276-288; idem, <em>The Gnostic Paul.&nbsp;Gnostic Exegesis of the Pauline Letters</em> (1975); and the wise cautions in A. Lindemann, <em> Paulus im ältesten&nbsp;Christentum. Das Bild des Apostels and die Reception der paulinischen Theologie in der frühchristlichen Literatur&nbsp;bis Marcion</em> (Beiträge zur hist. Theol. 58, Tübingen, 1979), pp. 297-343.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">2. 'Circumcision Will Cause Christ No Longer To Benefit You Unless I Arrange For You To Be Circumcised'</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Paul was willing to appear he and his closest followers were outwardly righteous but inwardly Paul did not believe in the necessity of believing in the external action performed to appear righteous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">For example, as to Timothy’s circumcision, Luke records:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">“Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him.” (Acts16:3)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">But elsewhere Paul says: “I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision,<strong><em> <em><strong>Christ will be of no advantage to you</strong></em></em></strong>. I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that<strong><em> he is obligated to keep the whole Law</em></strong>” (Gal5:2).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">So was Timothy now obligated to keep the whole Law? Or did Timothy and Paul participate in a hypocritical show of obedience to the Law just like the Pharisees whom Jesus condemned for such behavior?</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">3. 'We Are Released From The Law But We Also Uphold The Law'</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">An identical self-contradiction in Paul arises relating to Paul's view of the Law.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">“But now&nbsp;<strong><em>we are released from the Law</em></strong>.. we serve not under the old written code but under the new life of the Spirit” (Romans7:6).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Compare this with</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">“Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary,&nbsp;<strong><em>we uphold the law!</em></strong>” (Romans 3:31).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Which way is it?</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">4. 'Outer Cup Clean Is Enough Even Though I Do Not Have To Obey The Law'</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">We see Paul's willingness to mold himself to whom he wishes to win rather than have a non-hypocritical integrity. Listen to this next quote, and keep in mind what Jesus said about Pharisees like Paul who wash the outside of the cup but inwardly do not have the heart that follows their actions -- they are hypocrites.&nbsp;Paul says he is ‘all things to all men’ in this passage:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">“To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. <strong><em>To those under the law I<strong><em> became as one under the law</em></strong> (though&nbsp;<strong><em>not being myself under the law</em></strong>)</em></strong> that I&nbsp;<strong>might win those under the law</strong>. To those outside the law<strong><em> I became as one outside the law</em></strong> (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that&nbsp;<strong><em>I might win those outside the law</em></strong>. To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have<em><strong> become all things to all men, that I might save some</strong></em>.” 1Cor9:20+.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">With this hypocritical strategy, Jesus said the Pharisees could not save anyone,&nbsp;<em><em>i.e.</em>,</em> could not lead anyone to God. Instead, Jesus said their followers would become twice the sons of hell (Matt.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23:1-15&amp;version=NIV">23:15</a>) as the hypocritical teachers who taught like Paul explicitly does.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>5. Bearing Burdens of Others or Just You of Yourself</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This is a clear self-contradiction by Paul that has no explanation:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><sup>2 </sup>Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+6%3A2&amp;version=NIV">Gal 6:2</a> NIV)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><sup>5 </sup>For every man shall bear his own burden. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%206:5&amp;version=KJV">Gal 6:5</a>.)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">So am I supposed to bear your burden, and you mine, or each of us is to bear our own burden?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">By the way, the true God teaches neither is correct. Instead:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong><em>“Cast your burden on the Lord–and He will sustain you.”</em></strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Psalm 55:21</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Peter talks likewise:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong><em>“Cast all your cares upon Him–because He cares about you!”</em></strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">1 Peter 5:7</span></p>
<h3><strong>A Real Life Example of Pauline Use of This Admitted Contradiction - 2015</strong>. A core-leader of a famous church in Southern California recently came to our small group meeting and used this contradiction as proof that the church is free NOT to help a poor person financially in a health emergency. We were struggling with whether it was right or wrong to help with a health-related emergency of an AIDS victim. She had been in and out of hospitals all week, collapsing at home, and was rushed to the hospital by people responding to her phone requests to take her to the hospital. &nbsp;But now after returning home, &nbsp;she realized that due to her many visits to the hospital that she had lost track that her cell minutes needed recharging. Her minutes would expire on a Friday night. Without an emergency replenishment -- and she had no money or way to travel to get the replenishment -- she would be home alone over a weekend with no way to call for help if she collapsed again. So my wife paid her phone minutes to cover the weekend and more. This led to the head of the HIV-AIDS ministry of the church to come to meet with our small group to review the "rules" of care-giving for AIDS victims. This leader actually cited the contradiction in Paul's words above as proof that sometimes it is right to help and sometimes wrong to help the poor. She quoted: "We are to bear our own burden" and "We are to bear each other's burdens." Then the HIV-AIDS leader said, "that is a contradiction, isn't it?" She concluded that this means we have to sometimes make a hard choice not to bear another's burden, and force them to bear it alone.</h3>
<h3>But what about a health emergency? To this, we were instructed that there is no exception to the care-giving rules -- no money can be spent to help even with a health emergency without first calling the head of the HIV-AIDS ministry (this very nice lady) for permission. Whether this is right or wrong is not the point. Rather, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the point is that Pauline thinking allows one to rely upon Paul's recognized self-contradictions so we get to pick and choose which side of a contradiction we will follow.</span></strong></h3>
<h3>This example proves that Paul's self-contradictions have real-world impact upon the health and safety of this AIDS victim, as well as likely many others.</h3>
<h3>By the way, my wife and I have decided to leave any fellowship with this church as a result. These rules stink! Incredibly, there is even a rule that a care-team of several persons, as our group of 6 represented, is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">not supposed to spend talking to this AIDS victim more than 4 hours a week</span></strong>. Yet, the AIDS victim is lonely and likes talking to my wife, and not so much the others. This was frowned upon, and somehow my wife is responsible to restrain the calls. My wife was then told about another supposed rule -- <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">she cannot go visit the AIDS victim without taking someone with her</span></strong>. Why is friendship constrained thusly? I cannot fathom the reason for that rule.</h3>
<h3>What degradation has the church of Christ fallen when Jesus' commands to feed, clothe, and heal the sick are restrained by such nonsense. Incredibly, these rules are all in print! I am keeping them in permanent scan if anyone wants to see the nonsense to which a Pauline-influenced church will fall. I will redact the name of the church. &nbsp;My point is not to single out any particular church, but instead to expose how far Paulinism is a disease destroying the clarity of Christ's message.</h3>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;" data-mce-mark="1">Conclusion</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">While Paul may say some things worthy of praise, Paul is fraught with contradictions of Jesus, the Original Testament, and with his own self! Paul could not be a true inspired individual in every word he spoke, and thus we have erred treating Paul's words in that manner.</span></p>

See&nbsp;<a href="http://bible.cc/john/19-36.htm" style="color: #517291; text-decoration: underline;">John 19:36</a>&nbsp;("These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "<em><strong>Not one of his bones will be broken,</strong></em>")&nbsp;But Paul in the King James version of 1 Cor. 11:24 says to the contrary that Jesus claimed His body was to be "broken," and in doing so, Paul would misquote Jesus' communion words from Matthew&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26%3A26-27&amp;version=NIV" style="color: #517291; text-decoration: underline;">26:26</a>&nbsp;and Luke <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22%3A19&amp;version=NIV">22:19</a>.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">In 1 Cor. 11:24, Paul in the King James quotes Jesus saying "this is my body<strong>&nbsp;broken&nbsp;</strong>for you." (KJV, Aramaic, King James 2000, American King James, Websters, Weymouth, World English, Young's Literal). </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">However, many translations do not have "broken." See Biblios&nbsp;<a href="http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/11-24.htm" style="color: #517291; text-decoration: underline;">1 Cor. 11:24</a>. So the following translations only say "my body is for you" -- NIV, NLT, ESV, NASB, ISV, God's Word, Darby. There are some variants that support this, which I will discuss in a moment. But what is <em><strong>most interesting to see is how Paulinists of the past</strong> </em>who are believers in the Textus Receptus upon which the KJV is based, <em><strong>explained away the contradiction</strong></em>. They were apparently unaware that any textual variant offered an escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">So this led to humorous but also tragic arguments by Paulinists. They claim <span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>Jesus supposedly spoke directly to Paul to correct Matthew</strong></span>!!!! So Barnes, without telling us precisely what is the difference, writes:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span style="color: #001320; text-align: justify; background-color: #fffefd;">And when he had given thanks - See the note on&nbsp;</span><a href="http://bible.cc/matthew/26-26.htm" style="color: #0092f2; text-decoration: underline; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: justify; background-color: #fffefd;">Matthew 26:26</a><span style="color: #001320; text-align: justify; background-color: #fffefd;">. Matthew reads it, "and blessed it." The words used here are, however, substantially the same as there; and this fact shows that<span style="background-color: #ffff00;"> since this was communicated to Paul "directly" by the Saviour</span>, and<em><strong>&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffff00;">in a manner distinct from that by which Matthew learned the mode of the institution, the Saviour designed that the exact form of the words should be used in its observance</span></strong></em>, and should thus be constantly borne in mind by his people. (See "Barnes' Notes on the Bible at Biblios on<a href="http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/11-24.htm" style="color: #517291; text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;1 Cor. 11:24.</a>)</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="color: #001320; font-family: 'times new roman', times; text-align: justify; background-color: #fffefd; font-size: medium;">Other commentators unwilling to engage in such absurd elevation of Paul over Matthew realize Paul directly contradicts Luke whose words are "given" not broken. So they try to reconcile Paul to the Gospel's claim that none of Jesus' bones were broken:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="color: #001320; font-family: 'times new roman', times; text-align: justify; background-color: #fffefd; font-size: medium;">broken for you; for though a bone of him was not broken, but inasmuch as his <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">skin and flesh were torn and broken by blows with rods and fists,</span> by whippings and scourgings, by thorns, nails, and spear; and body and soul were torn asunder, or divided from each other by death; (Gill's Exposition Biblios on&nbsp;<a href="http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/11-24.htm" style="color: #517291; text-decoration: underline;">1 Cor. 11:24</a>.)</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="color: #001320; font-family: 'times new roman', times; text-align: justify; background-color: #fffefd; font-size: medium;">So to save Paul from contradiction, Paulinists who accept the KJV's manuscript source insist either (a) Matthew got it wrong / incomplete, and Jesus had to talk to Paul to get it right, or (b) that Jesus did say his "body was broken" but this just meant broken skin or the separation of his spirit from his body. <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">When you see how strained and strange are the efforts at reconciliation, one can see how wed Paulinists are to their hero.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: #494a44; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><span style="color: #001320; font-family: 'times new roman', times; text-align: justify; background-color: #fffefd; font-size: medium;"> But alas, the "broken" text relied upon in the KJV is likely a mistake in transmission, and Paul did not likely contradict Christ in this passage. So please scratch this from your list of possible contradictions.</span></p>
