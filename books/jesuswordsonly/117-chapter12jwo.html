<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1">Historical Evidence for The Trial Spoken Of In Revelation 2:2</span></strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464122"></a>Apart from what we reviewed so far from the Bible, are there any historical records of a trial of Paul<a name="marker=464123"></a>? Yes, indeed there are.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464127"></a>According to&nbsp;<a name="marker=464124"></a>Eusebius (260-340 A.D.) and&nbsp;<a name="marker=464125"></a><a name="marker=464126"></a>Epiphanius (315?-403 A.D.), there was an early Christian group known as the Ebionites. They made findings judicial in character about Paul's background. These findings claimed both of Paul's parents were Gentile. Further, they found Paul was not circumcised until he was an adult. See below "Ebionite Charges Against Paul."&nbsp;Obviously, the implication of these findings was that Paul lied when he made claims to the contrary. (See<a name="marker=464134"></a>Philippians <a href="http://bible.cc/philippians/3-5.htm">3:5</a>.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464135"></a>When Eusebius mentioned the Ebionites' findings, he launched attacks on the Ebionites, challenging their orthodoxy. Eusebius charged the Ebionites were heretics. They supposedly did not believe in the virgin birth.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464139" class="footnote"> 2</a> They also taught the Law had not been done away with. While it is likely true that the Ebionites believed Paul erred by abolishing the Law, the question of what they taught on the virgin birth account in Luke's Gospel may have been exaggerated or inaccurately portrayed. There are no clearly recognized writings of the Ebionites on these issues which actually have survived. Therefore, we cannot validate Eusebius' accusation. Nor did Eusebius quote any records of the Ebionites that could substantiate the charges. Thus, these accusations merely serve as ad hominem which do not resolve the claims of Paul's truthfulness about his heritage, as we shall see.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464147"></a>Regardless, we are obliged to re-weigh the facts. First,&nbsp;<a name="marker=464148"></a>Eusebius in particular appeared willing to exaggerate his attacks on the Ebionites. The reason was precisely because the Ebionites wanted Paul excluded from canon. Eusebius did not want Paul discredited. What was Eusebius' motivation in preventing Paul from being discredited? Was it to protect a true prophet or for political reasons? Eusebius was associated closely with Emperor&nbsp;<a name="marker=464149"></a>Constantine.&nbsp;<a name="marker=464150"></a>Eusebius was a promoter of the new-found powers of the bishop of Rome granted by Constantine's decrees. How would this potentially impact Eusebius' treatment of the Ebionites who attacked Paul?</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464152"></a><a name="38888"></a>The answer is obvious. After Peter founded the church of Rome and left, Paul arrived and appointed&nbsp;<a name="marker=464153"></a>the first bishop of the church of Rome (Linus), according to <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Constitution of the Apostles</span> (ca. 180-200 A.D.) at 7:46. That means Paul appointed the very first pope of Rome--although the name pope for the bishop of Rome was not yet in use. (Peter never apparently used the label bishop to identify his status at Rome.) Thus, the validity of the lineage of the Roman church depended&nbsp;<a name="marker=464154"></a>crucially upon Paul. If Paul were discredited, it would discredit the Roman Catholic church virtually from inception.<strong><a name="pgfId=464155"></a></strong></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1">Why No Other Ebionite Writings Survived</span></strong></span></h3>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464156"></a>We do not know the Ebionites' true views because we cannot find the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464157"></a>Ebionite works preserved in any library anywhere. Imperial Rome beginning with&nbsp;<a name="marker=464158"></a>Theodosius' reign (379-395) outlawed any religion&nbsp;<a name="marker=464159"></a>but that of the "bishops of Rome" (<span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Codex Theod</span>. XVI, I, 2). This was enforced by the destruction of both public and private libraries in Roman territories. If any heretical material was found, the owner suffered the death penalty. This suppression of historical works was interpreted broadly. For example, in 371, Emperor Valens ordered troops to remove from private homes at Antioch (Syria) works on liberal arts and the law, not just heretical works. "Discouraged and terrorized people all over the eastern provinces of the Empire, wishing to avoid any possible suspicion, began to burn their own libraries."<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464162" class="footnote"> 3</a> This grew worse under Theodosius. Then in 435 and 438, the emperors of Rome again commanded the public burning of unorthodox books throughout the empire.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464163"></a>So effective were these decrees, that there is not one single record written by an Ebionite that we can find preserved anywhere in any library. We know them only through the interpretation of their enemies. Our only records on the Ebionites' views are what Roman government authorities allowed to escape from the fire because the Ebionite's writings were quoted in the approved writings of Eusebius and Epiphanius.</span></p>

How so?</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464169"></a>Many of the sectarian works at the Dead Sea are written by a group who in Hebrew call themselves the Ebyonim or Ebion--The Poor. They even describe themselves as the "Congregation of the Poor."<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464174" class="footnote"> 4</a> The Poor of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) claimed to be followers of "The Way," part of "The New Covenant" who found the "Messiah" who is called the "Prince of the Congregation" and "Teacher of Righteousness." He is gone, killed at the urging of the priests at Jerusalem. After the departure of the Messiah (who will return), the temporal leader who led the Poor was called the Just One<em>, i.e</em>., Zaddik in Hebrew.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464176"></a>Furthermore, their leader--the Zaddik--is in a struggle against the "Spouter of Lies" who seeks to seduce the New Covenant community from following the Law of Moses. The Poor (Ebion) reject the idea Habakkuk 2:4 means justification is by faith and insist its meaning is "justification by faithfulness." The DSS Ebion have two writings both called "Justification by Works" which reaffirm their rejection of the position of the "Spouter of Lies."</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464177"></a>When we compare the Ebion of the Dead Sea Scrolls to what Eusebius describes as the Ebionites, the similarities are striking. The Christian sect of Ebionites seem to match the writings of the Poor (Ebyonim, Ebion) whose writings were found at the Dead Sea site of Qumram. These Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) reflect ideas and thoughts that are unmistakably Christian.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464180" class="footnote"> <sup>5</sup></a> The question is whether the writings of The Poor found at Qumram pre-date or post-date Christ.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464183"></a>Unfortunately, this cannot be done by carbon dating the papers found at the Dead Sea. Such dates only tell us the date of the age of the paper. Carbon dating can not tell us the date of the writing on the paper. Yet, we have other reliable means to identify the date of the activity of the people whose writings were preserved at Qumram. Fifty-seven to sixty-nine percent of all the coins in the Dead Sea caves are from the period 44-69 A.D.--part of the Christian era. Thus, the only way to know whether Christians or non-Christians wrote these writings is to study the words on the pages of the DSS.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464185"></a><a name="30042"></a>Professor Eisenman finds significant proof the Dead Sea Ebyonim is a Christian group. For example, in the DSS, the temporal ruler of the Ebion who succeeds the killed Messiah (who will return) is called the Zaddik. Numerous ancient sources outside the DSS identify James the Just (the brother of Jesus) as The Zaddik. Translated, this means Just One.&nbsp;<a name="marker=464186"></a>Jerome by the 400s will call him James the Just. In Christian writings of that era, the name of James was rarely used. He was merely called the Zaddik or Just One.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464189" class="footnote"> <sup>6</sup></a> As we saw previously, James--the Zaddik--was the first bishop of Jerusalem after Jesus' resurrection.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464195" class="footnote"> <sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464196"></a>So is it then mere coincidence that the head of the Ebion of the Dead Sea Scrolls is called the Zaddik? Of course not. Professor Eisenman appears to have stumbled upon a major discovery.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464197"></a>If Professor Eisenman is correct, this means the Ebionites in Eusebius' writings are the Jerusalem Church under James. What Professor Eisenman then notes to corroborate this idea is that Paul refers twice to sending money to the poor at Jerusalem. Eisenman says this just as easily could be The Poor. (<a href="http://bible.cc/romans/15-26.htm">Rom. 15:26</a>; Gal. 2:9-<a href="http://bible.cc/galatians/2-10.htm">10</a>.) If we translate back Paul's words into Hebrew, he was saying <em>The Ebion</em> of Jerusalem was the name of the church under James. They were the Congregation of the Poor, just like we might call a church The Lighthouse Church. We do not see Paul's intent due to case size in the standard text which changes The Poor into the poor.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464200" class="footnote"> <sup>8</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464201"></a>What heightens the probability Professor Eisenman is correct is recent archaeology. The initial hypothesis was that the DSS were exclusively the writings of an Essene sect from the 200 B.C. era. This idea recently crumbled in 2004. Golb's contrary hypothesis that the DSS came from the Temple at Jerusalem between 65-70 A.D. has now been strongly confirmed by extensive archaeological digs under auspices of Israeli universities. These digs proved there was no community site of monks at Qumram. It was a clay plate factory. The initial inference of a large community of monks from the presence of a large number of plates misinterpreted the evidence. Second, we can now infer the scrolls were hidden in the mountains to protect the scrolls, and not because a large community had been involved in copying activity. In fact, archaeology now proves there was no copy center or Scriptorum, as originally claimed. None of the metal clips copyists use to guide copying were found at Qumram. A few ordinary pens and numerous coins were found. Yet, no metal clips of copyists. Not even a fragment of one!</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464202"></a>The very nature of the scrolls likewise demonstrate that no monkish community was engaged in copying them. The&nbsp;<a name="marker=464203"></a>Dead Sea Scrolls, it turns out, are not only an eclectic collection of sectarian materials but also a cache with numerous copies of the Bible texts. This is just what one would expect to find from the Temple Library at Jerusalem had it been secreted away in advance of the Roman troops sieging Jerusalem prior to 70 A.D. The Essenes would not be expected, by contrast, to preserve several opposing strains of sectarian writings. One such strain is the writings of The Poor--The Ebion. On the other hand, we would expect to find Jewish Rabbis at Jerusalem wanting to keep copies of Christian writings for informational purposes at the Library of the Temple of Jerusalem. We would expect to find records of sectarian differences maintained by such a library.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464205"></a><a name="marker=464204"></a>Golb's argument has now essentially been vindicated. Golb made a scholarly case that the DSS are writings that were taken from the Temple at Jerusalem during the years of the Roman siege that finally prevailed in 70 A.D. Hiding them in these caves preserved them from the torches which in the end destroyed the Temple in 70 A.D. after a long siege.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464208" class="footnote"> 9</a></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464209"></a>Thus, recent archaeological discoveries at Qumram establish that many of the documents can be potentially prepared in the Christian-era. We no longer are forced to disregard the Christian character of certain writings merely because of the Essene hypothesis which strangled DSS studies until now. Among the newer writings in the DSS, we find some in Hebrew written by a group calling itself The Poor--The Ebion. This transliterates very well as The Ebionites.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464212" class="footnote"><sup>10</sup></a><strong><a name="pgfId=464216"></a></strong></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1">Do The Dead Sea Scrolls Depict A Trial of Paul?</span></strong></span></h3>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464217"></a>What is highly intriguing is a further theory of Professor&nbsp;<a name="marker=464218"></a>Eisenman about Paul. He claims the Poor's writings in the DSS speak of a trial of Paul. He says James is depicted as Paul's key antagonist in a heated confrontation where Paul spoke vigorously against James. Paul's effort was viewed as an attempt to split the group. Eisenman bases this on two DSS writings. The first is the Habakkuk Pesher, a commentary on Habakkuk 2:4--a favorite verse of Paul. The DSS author interprets the verse, however, to require faithfulness for salvation. The Pesher then rejects the idea that justification is without adding works to faith.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464219"></a>Professor Eisenman sensibly asks us how can we credibly believe this Pesher on Habakkuk 2:4 is directed at anyone else than Paul. As we shall see next, the DSS Poor are up in arms about "the spouter of Lies" who opposes the Zaddik. Are we to believe it is merely coincidence again the Ebion of the DSS just so happen to want to show Habakkuk 2:4--one of Paul's favorite proof texts--does not stand for an idea that Paul alone is known to have espoused? Eisenman concludes we are clearly witnessing deconstruction of Paul's doctrines in the DSS Ebion-ite materials.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464220"></a>It is the next document found among the Dead Sea Scrolls which is the key document to identify Paul as the object of a trial by the Poor (Ebyonim) of the DSS. This&nbsp;<a name="marker=464221"></a>faith-works discussion of the Habakkuk Pesher continues in a work by The Poor entitled the <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Damascus Document</span>. It says the contrary view on "works" justification is held by the "Spouter of Lies" who resists the "Zaddik." The "<a name="marker=464222"></a>Spouter of Lies" seeks to have the "Congregation of the New Covenant" depart from the Law. A heated public confrontation occurs between the Zaddik and the Spouter of Lies. You can find this <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Damascus Document</span> in any of the many compendiums of the DSS to verify this yourself.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464223"></a>Professor Eisenman claims this <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Damascus Document</span> is<strong><em> too uncanny a reference to Paul and James</em></strong> to claim it reflects a pre-Christian debate. It appears Professor Eisenman has the better case on this point as well. The DSS scholars who initially dominated the field tried to maintain this <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Damascus Document</span> is a pre-Christian document. They did so to serve their now discredited all-encompassing Essene theory.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464226" class="footnote"> <sup>11</sup></a> They ignored the contrary internal evidence in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Damascus Document</span>. This is one of the very few DSS documents that was found long before the 1950s and outside the Dead Sea area. When the <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Damascus Document</span> was originally found in Egypt in the 1890s, its contents led pre-eminent historians to regard it as a Christian writing. George<a name="marker=464227"></a>Margoliouth of the British Museum said in 1910 and 1911 that the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464228"></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Damascus Document</span> was written around the time of the destruction of the Second Temple (i.e., 70 A.D.), and was the work of the "Sadducean Christians of Damascus."<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464231" class="footnote"> <sup>12</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464232"></a>Margoliouth's opinion was given long before the DSS discovery at Qumran in the 1950s. It antedated by forty years the premature fixation on Essenes of 200 B.C. as the authors of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Damascus Document</span>. This fact proves an objective assessment of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Damascus Document</span> would lead to a different result. One would conclude objectively it is a work of Christians known as The Poor who were zealous for the Law (Zadokites=Sadducean).</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464233"></a>We can also see this for ourselves. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Damascus Document</span> identifies the community as The Poor or Ebion in Hebrew. They followed the Zaddik, a label which independent and reliable sources prove was the moniker of James. The enemy of the Poor was the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464234"></a>Spouter of Lies, who sought to seduce the New Covenant community from following the Law. The NT evidence strongly suggests that Paul was accused of lying about his apostleship and Paul knew this.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464237" class="footnote"> 13</a>The NT evidence likewise demonstrates the Jerusalem church under James was known as The Poor. (<a name="marker=464240"></a>Rom. 15:26;&nbsp;<a name="marker=464241"></a>Gal. 2:9-10.) Early church evidence also demonstrates a group called Ebionites (which is a transliteration meaning The Poor) were Christians who felt Paul was seducing wrongly the Christian community from following the Law.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464242"></a>Professor Eisenman thus has the better case on the Christian-era aspect of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Damascus Document</span>. Then, if he is correct on its meaning, the DSS depiction of the Poor--The Ebion--perfectly and uniquely match the Ebionites of whom Eusebius spoke.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464243"></a>It then follows the Ebionites must be orthodox. They are to be equated with the Jerusalem church of The Poor under James. Eusebius must have engaged in distortion of their beliefs to serve his agenda of the 300s. Eusebius's purpose is self-evident. He wanted to discredit the Ebionites because of the <strong><em>centrality of Paul to the validity of the Roman Catholic Church</em></strong> (RCC). Many forget that after Peter's presumed founding of the church at Rome, it was Paul who had appointed the first bishop of Rome--Linus--of the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464244"></a>RCC.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464250" class="footnote"> 14</a> Today we call this bishop of Rome the pope. However, the Ebionites claimed Paul was to be ejected from canon as inconsistent with Jesus' position on the Law. If the Ebionites were right, this means the RCC was corrupted by Paul shortly after Peter founded the Roman church. Eusebius had no choice but to attack the Ebionites regardless of their high standing in the Church's recent memory. In fact, that high standing explains why Eusebius attacked them so vigorously.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464251"></a>Some believe it is inconceivable Eusebius could knowingly disparage the Jerusalem Church under James as legalists. However, even in our modern era, those wed to Paul make such a blatant disparagement of the Jerusalem church. Here is a quote of a fundamentalist Christian journal <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">The New Birth</span> condemning freely the Jerusalem Church of the twelve apostles and James:</span></p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464252"></a>The gospel of the Jerusalem church became a perverted gospel once the Law Covenant was fulfilled and set aside as the governing covenant economy. And the <strong><em>Jerusalem church would not accept this fact, but continued stubbornly trying to keep the Law Covenant</em></strong>. It will be explained in this article that trying to keep both the Law Covenant along with the New Covenant <strong><em>perverted the gospel of Christ</em></strong> and annulled both covenants. It was<em><strong> necessary for the Lord to take Paul out into the wilderness apart from all the others</strong></em> and teach him directly the pure gospel of Christ, because the gospel of the Jerusalem church was now a perverted gospel, Gal 1:11-24.

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464256"></a>All Eusebius was doing is precisely what <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">The New Birth</span> was doing. Eusebius was putting Paul's view of the Law as the measure to test the orthodoxy of James and the Jerusalem church. Under Paul's criteria, the Jerusalem church (The Ebion) became the heretics. Paul's words proved to Eusebius and the New Birth that the apostolic church was heretical. It is thus entirely reasonable and permissible to infer Eusebius knew he was talking about the Jerusalem church of the twelve apostles when he labelled the Ebionites as heretical legalists. This is what justified Eusebius either falsely or in a misleading manner to charge the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464257"></a>Jerusalem Church with denying the virgin birth because its Hebrew version of Matthew lacked any account of the birth narrative.<strong><a name="pgfId=464258"></a></strong></span></p>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464259"></a>Nevertheless, even if the Ebionites did not believe in the virgin birth as charged (see footnote 2 of this chapter for why this charge appears unfounded or does not involve true heresy), they still believed in Jesus' divinity and His resurrection. They were Jewish Christians. They simply did not regard the Law as abrogated. They still rested on the Saturday-<a name="marker=464260"></a>Sabbath. For this too they were condemned by Eusebius and Jerome later. Yet, resting on Saturday-<a name="marker=464261"></a>Sabbath was apostolic practice, as demonstrated by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Constitutions of the Apostles</span> dating at least to the early 200s.

In book XX, chapter 9, Josephus says Saulus is a member of the family of the successor, Herod (Antipas). Josephus says this Saulus sided with the High Priest in resisting a tumult by lower order priests over temple funds going to the High Priest. Josephus records this Saulus' activity was after Jesus' movement had already begun but before we know independently that Paul joined it. (<em>Antiquities</em>, XX 9.4.). This therefore puts the Saulus of Josephus in precisely the chronological position of&nbsp;<a name="marker=464313"></a>Saul (Paul) prior to his road to Damascus experience. Further, the Saulus of Josephus and the Saul of Acts both are collaborators of the High Priest (an appointee of&nbsp;<a name="marker=464314"></a>Herod). So when Josephus says Saulus was of the family of Herod, this is direct evidence that Saul-Paul was of the family of Herod.</span></li>

Paul's claim was accepted in Acts. It has several implications.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="Bulleted"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464340"></a>First, Roman citizenship was an honor from Rome which in the Judean region primarily only could be enjoyed by members of Herod's family or his closest allies. The list of Roman citizens was kept in Caesar's office in Rome. It was not a very long list. Most native-born Italians did not enjoy this privilege. In outlying provinces like Judea, it was dispensed to military allies and their families to give them special protection from Roman occupation forces. You could not torture or beat a Roman citizen.</span></li>
<li class="Bulleted"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464341"></a>Second, Roman citizenship from birth means Saul had to be given a Roman name from birth.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464344" class="footnote"> 17</a> It turns out that Paul is a Roman name.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464348" class="footnote"> 18</a></span></li>
<li class="Bulleted"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464349"></a>How did Paul happen to have a Roman birth name if he was truly Jewish? It cannot happen. A true Jewish family would not give their child a Roman name or even accept Roman citizenship from birth. This would represent defilement. Thus, Paul had to be from birth a non-Jew. However, his parents also named him Saul, which is a Jewish name. Thus, his parents aspired to be Jewish. This fits perfectly the Herodians. They would be non-Jews and Roman citizens, but they would also aspire to be Jewish.</span></li>
<li class="Bulleted"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464350"></a>Thus, in the Judea of that era, only Herodians would have a child with both a Roman and Hebrew name (Paul Saul) who would have Roman citizenship from birth (<a href="http://bible.cc/acts/22-28.htm">Acts 22:28</a>) and who would greet a "kinsman" (i.e., a relative) named Herodion. (Romans 16:11.) It thus is not a coincidence that Saul in Acts is a collaborator of the High Priest appointed by Herod. Nor is it insignificant that Saulus in Josephus is likewise a collaborator of the High Priest in precisely the time-frame of Saul-Paul prior to becoming a Christian. This then leads us to the unequivocal statement in Josephus that Saulus is a member of the Royal family of Herod Antipas.<a name="pgfId=464351"></a></span></li>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464353"></a>In fact, Paul being an&nbsp;<a name="marker=464352"></a>Herodian `Jew' would explain the presence of Herod's foster brother as a member of the Christian church at Antioch.

So who previously belonged to this church at Antioch?</span></p>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464357"></a>Who recruited Herod's brother? Someone had to do this. Someone of the family of Herod would be in the best position to do so. Saul-Paul, with Roman citizenship, would have the uncommon status to permit social contact with Herod's brother. If Josephus' reference to Saulus means Saul-Paul, and he was thus a member of Herod Antipas' family, then Paul likely recruited Herod's brother.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464358"></a>This <a href="http://bible.cc/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a> passage underscores once more the many uncanny links between Paul and Herod.

<ul>
<li class="Bulleted"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464359"></a>Romans 16:11, the greeting to Paul's relative, "Herodion."</span></li>

</ul>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464364"></a>Paul was thus <strong><em>apparently an Herodian Jew</em></strong>, not a true Jew.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464365"></a>Therefore, the available evidence strongly vindicates the investigation by the Ebionites. The&nbsp;<a name="marker=464366"></a>Ebionites could in a strict investigation prove that Paul did not have Jewish parents according to the rabbinic definition. Thus, while the Ebionites' doctrines made them want to exclude Paul because of his position on the Law, this did not apparently bias the result. It appears their claims on Paul's background are so substantial that we could conclude Paul was not a true Jew even without knowing the Ebionite claim on Paul's background.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464367"></a>The significance of trusting the Ebionite charge, however, is this means they were proving Paul to be untruthful. Paul claimed he was born a Jew and circumcised on the eighth day. (<a name="marker=464368"></a><a href="http://bible.cc/philippians/3-5.htm">Phil. 3:5</a>.) This fits right in with&nbsp;<a name="marker=464369"></a>Rev. 2:2 where the false claimant to apostleship was proven a liar at Ephesus. It also fits the parallel statement by Jesus about those who "lie" and "<em><strong>say they are Jews but are not.</strong></em>" (<a name="marker=464370"></a>Rev. 3:9.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464371"></a>Most important, the Ebionite charge has the characteristic of evidence one might bring up at a trial. It has a judicial ring to it. There is nothing polemical about it. No doctrines are involved. The charge purports to be the result of someone trying to find out more about Paul's background. Thus, it appears the Ebionites were involved in finding evidence to bring up at a trial regarding Paul.<strong><a name="pgfId=464372"></a></strong></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1">Evidence of Peter's Testimony Against Paul in a Trial</span></strong></span></h3>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464373"></a>Additional evidence of a trial of Paul comes from a sermon collection called the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464374"></a>Clementine Homilies from 200 A.D. Scholars believe it contains a smaller fragment from an earlier Ebionite writing about a trial involving Paul with Peter as a star witness against Paul. This fragment is stuck inside a later story written to appear as if the opponent is someone called&nbsp;<a name="marker=464375"></a>Simon Magus. (This was apparently done to avoid the censor's hand [or was Rufinus' the censor-translator suppressing Paul's name]) Instead scholars deduce the original fragment was certainly talking about Paul. This can be validated by comparing what Peter says to how Paul responds in statements we find in Acts chapters 22 and 26.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464376"></a><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1">Homily 17 and the Trial of Paul</span></strong></span></h3>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464378"></a>In this section of the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464377"></a><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Clementine Homilies</span></em>, Peter asks Simon Magus publicly why would Jesus come to an enemy in a vision. Peter wonders why would Jesus spend years teaching the apostles to have their message supplanted by someone who merely claims to have had a vision of Jesus. These are all good questions even if the fragment were really directed at a confrontation of Peter with Simon Magus. But was it?</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464379"></a>To answer that we need more background. This dialogue appears as Peter's testimony in a trial atmosphere. It is found in <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Clementine Homilies</span>: Homily 17. Scholars say this fragment's original source must have been written by the Ebionites. Later, it was inserted into the Clementine Homilies as if directed at someone else called&nbsp;<a name="marker=464380"></a>Simon Magus. Scholars concur that its original context was written to tell what transpired when Peter was testifying against Paul.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464385"></a>How do scholars deduce this? This fragment so clearly applies to Paul that it is inconceivable Simon Magus could involve all the same characteristics as Paul. As Alexander Roberts, the editor of <span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">The Anti-Nicene Fathers</span>, explains: "This passage has therefore been regarded as <em><strong>a covert attack upon the Apostle Paul.</strong></em>"<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464388" class="footnote"> <sup>19</sup></a> Likewise, Robert Griffin-Jones, a pro-Pauline scholar, admits Paul is the true adversary in this passage: "Paul is demonized...in a fictional dispute [in the<span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"> Clementine Homilies</span>] in which Peter trounces him."<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464392" class="footnote"> <sup>20</sup></a> Bart Ehrman concurs in this Homily that "Simon Magus in fact is a cipher for none other than Paul himself."<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=465051" class="footnote"><sup> 21</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464395"></a><a name="marker=464394"></a>If, then, our Jesus appeared to you in a vision, made Himself known to you, and spoke to you, it was as one who is <em><strong>enraged with an adversary</strong></em>; and this is the reason why it was through visions and dreams, or through revelations that were from without, that He spoke to you. But can any one be <em><strong>rendered fit for instruction through apparitions</strong></em>? And if you will say, `It is possible,' then I ask, `<strong><em>Why did our teacher abide and discourse a whole year to those who were awake</em></strong>?' And how are we to believe your word, when you tell us that He appeared to you? And how did He appear to you, when <strong><em>you entertain opinions contrary to His teaching</em></strong>? But if you were seen and taught by Him, and<strong><em> became His apostle for a single hour, proclaim His utterances, interpret His sayings, love His apostles, contend not with me who companied with Him</em></strong>. For in <em><strong>direct opposition to me</strong></em>, who am a firm rock, the foundation of the Church, you now stand. If you were not opposed to me, you would not accuse me, and revile the truth proclaimed by me, in order that I may not be believed when I state what I myself have heard with my own ears from the Lord, as if I were evidently<em><strong> a person that was condemned</strong></em> and in bad repute. But if you say that I am condemned, you bring an accusation against God, who revealed the Christ to me, and you inveigh against Him who pronounced me blessed on account of the revelation. But if, indeed, you really wish to work in the cause of truth, <strong><em>learn first of all from us what we have learned from Him</em></strong>, and, becoming a disciple of the truth, become a fellow-worker with us. (Ps-<a name="marker=464396"></a>Clementine Homilies 17,19.)<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=464399" class="footnote"> 22</a></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464401"></a>Let's test the possibility that Peter did in fact deliver this speech, and Paul heard it. We will find evidence in the New Testament that&nbsp;<a name="marker=464402"></a>Paul was aware of this charge that Peter made, as recorded in the <em>Clementine Homilies</em>. Paul's knowledge of this charge can be proven in how Paul embarrassingly changed his accounts of his vision with Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464403"></a>The version in Acts chapter 22 is precisely the vision that Peter is addressing in Homily 17, as it lacks any positive words from Jesus toward Paul. This must be what pressures Paul later to change the account into what we see in Acts chapter 26. This account reverses the Acts chapter 22 account. It puts words in Jesus' mouth for the first time that are positive toward Paul. However, by Paul changing the accounts, he demonstrates a<strong><em> clear contradiction</em></strong> with the earlier version in Acts chapter 22. Thus, the Acts chapter 26 account eliminates the point Peter raises in the Clementine Homily 17. However, it does so at a great price--terrible embarrassment when the later version of Acts chapter 26 is compared to Paul's earlier vision account in Acts chapter 22. Only something precisely like Peter's speech in Homily 17 can explain such a risky reversal of the vision account. We next examine the evidence for this.<strong><a name="pgfId=464404"></a></strong></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1">How Acts Mirrors the Clementine Homilies</span></strong></span></h3>
<h4><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464405"></a><strong><span style="color: #800080;" data-mce-mark="1">Point One: Jesus Only Words Are Negative in Acts Chapter 22</span></strong></span></h4>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464406"></a>The main argument in Peter's Clementine speech was that Paul's vision of Jesus involved Jesus only talking negatively to Paul. In fact, Homily 17, chapter 18 is devoted to Peter proving from Scripture that visions of God are how God reveals himself to enemies, not allies. In that context, Peter's point is unmistakable. Paul's vision only contains negative statements from Jesus, invalidating it as a proof of Paul's authority.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464407"></a>Then we will see that the account of Paul's vision given in Acts chapter 22 is exactly what Peter describes in <em>Clementine Homily</em> 17:19. In the Acts 22:7-16 account, the only positive statements come later from a person named Ananias. They do not come from Jesus at all, just as Peter says in this<a name="marker=464408"></a>Clementine Homily. Jesus' only words are negative toward Paul, as we discuss in detail below.</span></p>

This apparently relates to the fact that in 2 Timothy 1:15 Paul says all the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464413"></a>Christians in Asia (<em>i.e.</em>, modern Western Turkey, which includes Ephesus) abandoned him. This defense was thus put on inside a church-setting in Asia Minor. The verdict ended up that all Christians in proconsular Asia abandoned him, according to Paul's own words. (2 Tim. 1:15.) Paul then mentions he still regards he somehow escaped the "mouth of the lion..." at this defense he put on. What did he mean? Paul's words at&nbsp;<a name="marker=464414"></a>2 Timothy 4:14-17 are:</span></p>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464416"></a>These statements, all read together, point to Paul admitting he was tried by fellow-Christians in Asia Minor (where Ephesus was), he lost and was then forsaken by all those in that region.

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464427"></a>The more natural reading is that lion represents the Tribe of Judah, <em>i.e.</em>, the Jews. This also fits the historical context. Read this way, 2 Timothy 4:17 means Paul felt he somehow escaped the Judaizing Christians. Nevertheless, the verdict in Asia Minor was a severe loss to Paul of all influence in Asia Minor among Christians there. (2 Tim. 1:15.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464428"></a>Is lion a symbol of Judah? Yes. The lion is historically treated as a symbol of the tribe of Judah. It comes from the Bible. In Genesis 49:9, Judah is specifically called "a lion's whelp." In Numbers 24:9, the people of Israel are likened to a "lion." This symbol for the Tribe of Judah is repeated in Revelation 5:3, 5. Thus Paul's reference to the lion in 2 Timothy 4:17 is likely a reference to his Jewish-Christian opponents within the church.</span></p>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464430"></a>How can Paul escape yet lose all support? Peter's attack in the Ebionite account of a trial versus Paul goes to Paul's legitimacy. If in Paul's vision account, Jesus had no positive words for Paul, and we must rely upon&nbsp;<a name="marker=464431"></a>Ananias (who is no prophet) to confirm Paul's legitimacy, then<em><strong> Paul loses all legitimacy</strong></em>. Peter's argument in the <em>Clementine Homilies</em> says Paul's authority stands on nothing positive from Jesus. If all we ever had was the Acts chapter 22 vision-account, Peter says Paul stands on nothing from Jesus to confirm Jesus ever had a positive feeling toward Paul.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464432"></a>However, Paul could walk away from a trial he loses on whether he is an apostle (Rev. 2:2) if he walks away with some legitimacy. If Paul was at least viewed as having met Jesus who<strong><em> positively told him he would be a witness </em></strong>(not an apostle), it would be enough for Paul to survive as a legitimate authority among Christians. This is what the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464433"></a>vision account in Acts chapter 26 gives Paul, if the trial-judges believed Paul. Thus, at this trial, what Paul apparently means by saying he "escaped the lion" is that he was <strong><em>not stripped of all authority to teach and preach</em></strong>. He only could no longer call himself an apostle. (Rev. 2:2.) He salvaged a win on the only point that mattered to Paul up to that time. No one could disprove that Paul had seen Jesus and there were<em><strong> positive words for him</strong></em>. At least, no one could prove otherwise until Luke published Acts. There we see the vision account in Acts chapter 22 undercuts whether the Acts chapter 26 vision account ever took place. Let's next compare these two accounts to understand how Paul changed his accounts to save his legitimacy at a trial, but lost it for us when we critically compare the two versions.</span></p>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464442"></a>So imagine Peter has heard this same story from Paul, and only this story from Acts chapter 22. There is <strong><em>no word of approval from Jesus</em></strong>. Just condemnation. The only words ascribed to Jesus other than pure condemnation are these:</span></p>

(Acts 9:12-17; 22:12.) Peter says in the above passage of the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464448"></a><em>Clementine Homilies</em> to his opponent (Paul): "If, then, our Jesus appeared to you in a vision, made Himself known to you, and spoke to you, it was as one who is enraged with an adversary; and this is the reason why it was through visions and dreams...." Peter must be referring to Paul's Acts chapter 22 version of the vision account. It was a brief vision, nothing more. Jesus was adversarial in tone.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464449"></a>In Peter's charge, Peter has not seen or heard the next account of the vision, which we can read in Acts chapter 26. This not only proves Paul is the intended target from the Clementine fragment, but it also gives the Peter speech <strong><em>immense authenticity and reliability</em></strong>. Because if the Peter speech never really happened, there is<strong><em> little reason why Paul would go out of his way to contradict and put a whole new spin on his vision experience</em></strong> when we see Acts chapter 26. The purpose of Paul's switch in Acts chapter 26 is clear: it <strong><em>erases the criticism of Peter recorded in the Clementine Homilies.</em></strong> In Acts chapter 26, Jesus appears now to have approving words during Paul's vision experience.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464451"></a>To see this, we must read<a name="marker=464450"></a>Paul's next account of his vision in Acts chapter 26. It is a very different account indeed. Paul, talking to&nbsp;<a name="marker=464452"></a>Agrippa, states in<a name="marker=464453"></a>Acts 26:14-18:</span></p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464454"></a>(14) And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad.

(16) But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end<em> have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness [Gk. martus] </em>both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee; (17) delivering thee from the people, and from the <strong><em>Gentiles, unto whom I send thee</em></strong>, (18) to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me.

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464455"></a>Do you see that verses 16-18 are new very positive statements by Jesus?

Do you likewise see this Acts chapter 26 version undercuts Peter's argument in the speech from the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464456"></a><em>Clementine Homilies</em>? Do you further see that Peter could not possibly have known of this Acts chapter 26 version at the time Peter confronts his opponent (obviously Paul) in the <em>Clementine Homilies</em>?</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464459"></a>Thus, it makes the most sense that Acts chapter <span style="background-color: #ffff00;" data-mce-mark="1">22</span> reflects the account Paul first gave at trial in response to Peter's charge. This explains why Paul believes he "escaped" the mouth of the lion even though the result was that all Christians of Asia (Minor) abandoned Paul. (2 Tim. 1:15.) No one could disprove that Paul had some vision and there may have been positive statements by Jesus. These two vision accounts fell short of calling Paul an apostle. Paul lost the trial on that score. (Rev. 2:2.) Yet, in Paul's mind he won because he was not totally&nbsp;<a name="pgfId=464459"></a>de-legitimized.</span></p>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464460"></a>In reflection on Paul's various vision accounts, ask yourself this: how plausible is it that the version in Acts chapter 26 just happens to allow Paul to side-step Peter's charge? Furthermore, is it really plausible that both versions (Acts 22 and 26) are true? No, it is not.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464462"></a>In the later version,&nbsp;<a name="marker=464461"></a>Acts 26:16, Paul says that Jesus tells him he is appointed to be a witness (martus, martyr). However, in the earlier version of&nbsp;<a name="marker=464463"></a>Acts 22:13-15, Jesus is harsh and then simply says Paul will be told "all" that he is to do when he gets into town. Then in town, and only then, Paul learns he is being appointed to be a witness. The identical words that Ananias' used in Acts chapter 22 are now transferred, in the next account in Acts chapter 26, into Jesus' mouth. The implausibility of both accounts being true stems from this verse in Acts chapter 22 where Jesus supposedly tells Paul:</span></p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464464"></a>Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464466"></a>In this version from Acts chapter 22, Jesus himself says it is in Damascus that Paul will learn "all" of what to do. In the Acts chapter 26 version, everything that Paul was told in the Acts chapter 22 version in Damascus (which was in Ananias' mouth) is now given by Jesus before Paul even goes to Damascus. Both versions simply cannot be true. This is because<strong><em> 100% of what Ananias said in Acts chapter 22 is given by Jesus before Jesus in the vision departs in Acts chapter 26</em></strong>. So how can it be true that in Damascus Paul would learn for the first time "all things which are appointed for thee to do?" In the later account of Acts chapter 26, this 100% precedes Paul's trip to Damascus, <em><strong>making a liar out of Jesus in the Acts chapter 22 account</strong></em>. There Jesus said it would be given at Damascus. If you love the Lord Jesus more than Paul, the two stories are irreconcilable.</span></p>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464468"></a>This change between Acts chapter 22 and chapter 26 is what explains how Paul in his "first defense" was able to "escape the mouth of the lion," as he puts it in 2 Timothy 2:17. He apparently used this clever side-step. Paul simply made up more words of Jesus but this time words of approval before Jesus departs in the vision. Paul thereby made it <em><strong>appear Jesus is now a friend</strong></em>, and not an adversary. This explains why Paul's "first defense" spoken about in Second Timothy succeeded to some degree in Paul's mind even though "<em><strong>all in... Asia abandoned me</strong></em>." (<a name="marker=464469"></a>2 Tim. 1:15.) Paul felt he had success in holding onto some legitimacy even though the verdict was so bad that all in Asia Minor abandoned him. He must have felt his defense salvaged enough that he could believe he escaped the Jewish-Christian opponents that he faced. Thus, Paul apparently made up this Acts chapter 26 version of the Christ-vision on the spot. Paul was satisfied that in doing so he "escaped the mouth of the lion" even though he effectively lost and "all in...Asia abandoned me."</span></p>

John in 1 John told us, reminiscent of Revelations 2:2, to test every spirit to see whether it comes from God. There were several criteria he gave to tell the liars from the true.

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464487"></a>Now compare this to Peter's charge against his antagonist (<em>i.e.</em>, Paul) previously quoted from the Clementine Homilies:</span></p>

But if <em><strong>you say that I am condemned</strong></em>, you bring an accusation against God, who revealed the Christ to me, and you inveigh against Him who pronounced me blessed on account of the revelation. But if, indeed, you really wish to work in the cause of truth,<strong><em> learn first of all from us what we have learned from Him, and, becoming a disciple of the truth,</em></strong> become a fellow-worker with us.

(14) But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Cephas [i.e., <strong><em>Peter</em></strong>] before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?

"I resisted him to the face, because he stood<strong><em> condemned</em></strong>." Then&nbsp;<a name="marker=464517"></a>Paul says he gave Peter a dressing down "before them all." Paul did this publicly, not in private.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464519"></a>In doing this, Paul&nbsp;<a name="marker=464518"></a>violates his own command to us: "Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but appeal to him as a father." (<a name="marker=464520"></a>1 Tim. 5:1.) Paul also violated Jesus' command: "if your brother sins, go and reprove him in private; if he listens to you, you have won your brother." (<a name="marker=464521"></a>Matthew 18:15.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464522"></a>Yet, who was right in this public rebuke by Paul of Peter? There is strong reason to believe<strong><em> Paul was wrong, not Peter</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464524"></a>Paul was teaching Gentiles that it was&nbsp;<a name="marker=464523"></a>permissible to eat meat sacrificed to idols. (See Chapter Paul Contradicts Jesus on Idol Meats.) The twelve apostles tacitly approved James condemning this in Acts chapter 15. Jesus condemns it three times in the Book of Revelation.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464528"></a>Peter apparently discovered this practice by Paul. Peter then would have appropriately withdrawn from eating with Gentiles under Paul's infl<a name="marker=464529"></a>uence. Peter had to be obedient to Jesus who likewise condemned what Paul was permitting.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464530"></a>Thus, Paul admits in Galatians that he refused to follow the example of Peter's withdrawal from eating with Gentiles. Peter was probably simply obeying Christ. Now you as a Christian must choose: is Peter as an apostle of Jesus Christ somehow less authoritative than Paul who Jesus never once appointed as an apostle in three vision accounts? While most commentators assume Paul is in the right on the withdrawal issue, on what basis? Paul's say-so? Because Paul permits<a name="marker=464531"></a><a name="marker=464532"></a>eating meat sacrificed to idols but the twelve were misled in Acts chapter 15 to approve prohibiting it?</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464533"></a>One must not be influenced by Paul's one-sided account. We can see Paul had an eating practice that made dining with Gentiles under his influence impossible. Jewish custom was to avoid violating food laws by simply not eating with Gentiles. This way they would not offend their host by either asking about foods presented or by refusing foods Gentiles offered. This is all that Peter was doing: being polite as well as conscientious.</span></p>

<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464535"></a>Finally, Peter in the Clementine Homilies speech (previously quoted) asks his antagonist (Paul) a blunt question that remains valid even if Homily 17 were fictional:</span></p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464536"></a>And how did He appear to you, when you <strong><em>entertain opinions contrary to His teaching</em></strong>? But if you were seen and taught by Him, and became His apostle for a single hour, proclaim His utterances, interpret His sayings, love His apostles.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464538"></a>Doesn't anyone else find it&nbsp;<a name="marker=464537"></a>incongruous that not a single utterance from Jesus' teachings in the Gospel accounts are found in Paul's many letters? For Paul, Jesus is just the divine messiah who dies, resurrects and we must trust in this fact. Apart from that, Jesus' teachings are <strong>completely absent in Paul</strong>. Peter thinks this is a major flaw.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464539"></a>What Peter brings out in the <em>Clementine Homilies</em> again can be corroborated by looking at Paul's writings. Paul admits in Galatians that after he was converted, he then began his work for fourteen years before he ever went back to Jerusalem to learn from the apostles who knew Jesus. (Gal. 2:1.) Paul admits that until that time, he only had a brief two week visit to Jerusalem three years after his vision. Paul emphasizes his lack of contact with the twelve by pointing out that in those two weeks he only met Peter and then briefly&nbsp;<a name="marker=464540"></a>James, the Lord's brother. Paul adamantly insists this is his sole prior encounter with the apostles within "<strong><em>fourteen years</em></strong>" (Gal. 2:1):</span></p>
<p class="Quote" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=464541"></a>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb... To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately <strong><em>I conferred not with flesh and blood: Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me</em></strong>; but I went into <em><strong>Arabia,</strong></em> and returned again unto Damascus. Then after three [more] years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. But other of the apostles I saw none, save James the Lord's brother. Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. (<a name="marker=464542"></a>Galatians 1:8-21)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a name="pgfId=465090"></a>Peter in the Clementine Homily 17 thus asks a very good question. If Jesus spent a year with the apostles after the resurrection teaching them, Jesus obviously did so in order that their witness would be full and superior to others. Then it was incumbent on Paul to learn from them. Yet, by Paul's own<a name="marker=465091"></a>admission, Paul fails to do so for years. How then can Paul form the greater body of New Testament Scripture when his ideas are not based on Jesus' teachings? Isn't that a red flag right there? Christianity is being expounded by someone who never spent any extended time with Jesus, never trained under him, and whose writings are devoid of utterances of Jesus except a small unique aphorism and only one inaccurate quote from the Lord's&nbsp;<a name="marker=465092"></a>supper account.<a href="file:///C:/Writings%20in%20Process/JWO%20Redo%20Formatting/Final%20Framemaker%20Archive/chapter%2012html.html#pgfId=465096" class="footnote"> <sup>26</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Footnote"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span class="footnoteNumber" data-mce-mark="1">2.</span> <a name="pgfId=464139"></a>There is never any legitimate quote offered to prove the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464138"></a>Ebionites denied the virgin birth. Rather, what is offered as proof by Eusebius is primarily an argument from silence. The original Ebionite version of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew was missing what we all today see as the virgin birth narrative. From this absence, the charge was made that the Ebionites did not believe in a virgin birth. However,&nbsp;<a name="marker=464140"></a>Jerome ca. 400 A.D. validated the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464141"></a>Hebrew Matthew of the Ebionites. He cited several small variances from the Greek translation of the original Hebrew Matthew. None implied any unorthodox view. Thus, was the omission of the virgin birth narrative proof of heresy? No, because the same virgin-birth narrative is missing from Mark and John. Eusebius also tried to smear the Ebionites by claiming&nbsp;<a name="marker=464142"></a>Symmachus, a Jewish scholar, was one of them. Symmachus disputed apparently the accuracy of the Greek Matthew's translation in Matthew chapter 1 of&nbsp;<a name="marker=464143"></a>Isaiah 7:14 on the word virgin. Symmachus was correct. Therefore the fact this passage in Greek with its&nbsp;<a name="marker=464144"></a>erroneous translation of Isaiah 7:14 is missing in the Hebrew Matthew actually heightens the validity of the Ebionite Matthew as more authentic. Regardless, Symmachus was never a Christian, and was anti-Matthew. He could not possibly be an Ebionite. The Ebionites were pro-Matthew. The impetus to bring exaggerated charges against the Ebionites was due to their position on Paul. There is no substantial evidence, pro or con, to support the Ebionites denied a virgin birth. Even if they did, because John, Mark and probably the original Matthew omit this story, how can it be a core doctrine of the church? How could denying the virgin birth make one a heretic? Jesus could still be from "everlasting" (Micah 5:2)<strong><em> if God occupied Jesus conceived by Mary and Joseph</em></strong>. In fact, one could make the case that the&nbsp;<a name="marker=464145"></a>virgin birth account in Luke contradicts the prophecy that Jesus had to be of the lineage of David. (<a name="marker=464146"></a>Jeremiah 23:6.) If there was a virgin birth, then Jesus would be, as the Epistle of Hebrews says, of the Order of Melchisedek, with no human father. How could an adoption by Joseph truly satisfy the prophecy of Jeremiah 23:6? This perhaps was the problem raised by the Ebionites with Luke's virgin birth account. We may never know for certain. Yet, if the Ebionites disputed the virgin birth, it could not possibly make them real heretics.</span></p>

(The word Essene never once appears in the DSS.) The real mystery is how all these writings, reflecting divergent views, all appear at Qumram. Golb's theory is the one that best fits all the facts.

After Peter founded the church of Rome and left, Paul arrived and appointed the first bishop of the church of Rome (Linus), according to Constitution of the Apostles (ca. 180-200 A.D.) at 7:46. That means Paul appointed the very first pope of Rome--although the name pope for the bishop of Rome was not yet in use. (Peter never apparently used the label bishop to identify his status at Rome.) Thus, the validity of the lineage of the Roman church depended crucially upon Paul. If Paul were discredited, it would discredit the Roman Catholic church virtually from inception. supra.</span></p>

However, there is no mention of this in the three accounts of Paul's vision in Acts chs. 9, 22, and 26. In the middle of Acts, Luke starts referring to Saul as Paul, with no explanation. Nor does Paul explain in any of his letters why he uses the name Paul. It turns out that Paul is a Roman name. Saul is a Hebrew name. There is an apocryphal account that Paul took his name from a Roman official Paulus whom he converted. Yet, to be a citizen from birth, one must have a Roman name from birth. Paulus must have been it.</span></p>

Roberts then explains: "This passage has therefore been regarded as a covert attack upon the Apostle Paul."</span></p>

Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson; rev'd A. Cleveland Coxe) Vol. VIII (Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson Publishing Inc., 1994) at 269 et seq. This is available online at http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-08/anf08-61.htm#P5206_1525700. These Clementine Homilies were part of church history since the 200s, and even were frequently official readings in the early church. They purported to be written by&nbsp;<a name="marker=464400"></a>Clement, the bishop at Rome around 96 A.D. Scholars of today claim these letters were written around 200, and included within them the earlier tradition of the Ebionites, such as in this passage. Because they were not apparently written by Clement, in fact, they are now labelled The Pseudo Clementine Homilies.</span></p>

Jerome says that in Paul's first encounter with Nero he dismissed him as harmless.&nbsp;<a name="marker=464426"></a>Jerome says lion "clearly [is] indicating Nero as lion on account of his cruelty." (Jerome, <em>Lives of Famous Men</em>, ch. V.) However, Jerome is alluding to the Paul-Seneca correspondence as proof of the Paul-Nero encounter. However, most scholars find good reason to regard those letters as illegitimate, and this encounter as a highly improbable myth. Second, Jerome does not say Nero's nickname was lion, just that the label might fit him and be Paul's intention.</span></p>

Then this means Paul's legitimacy depends 100% on the legitimacy of Ananias. However, there is no evidence from Luke in Acts or anywhere in the New Testament that Ananias is a prophet (i.e., by means of confirmed prophecy). As Gregg Bing unwittingly admits in "Useful for the Master," <em>Timely Messenger</em> (November 2004): "<strong><em>Ananias...was not an apostle, a pastor, or a prophet</em></strong>, as far as we know, but was simply what many would call an ordinary man." Peter in the Homily realizes that the validity of thinking Jesus spoke positively to Paul mistakenly ignores that Paul's positive commission in Acts chapter 22 solely comes from an uninspired non-prophet named Ananias.</span></p>

<p class="Footnote"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span class="footnoteNumber" data-mce-mark="1">25.</span> <a name="pgfId=464502"></a>Paul sneers at the three "so-called" leaders at Jerusalem: James, Cephas (i.e., Simon Peter) and John, adding pejoratively that they "seemed to be pillars" (<a name="marker=464503"></a>Galatians 2:9). Paul then&nbsp;<a name="marker=464504"></a>boasts that he believes he is at their level: "For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles" (<a name="marker=464505"></a>2 Corinthians 11:5). And in&nbsp;<a name="marker=464506"></a>2 Corinthians 12:11, Paul claims "in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing." There is some textual and historical reasons to think Paul calls the twelve false apostles in&nbsp;<a name="marker=464507"></a>2 Cor. 11:12-23, viz. verse 13 "fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ." (Other than the twelve, who else claimed to be apostles other than Paul? No one that we know.) Another example of derogation involves the apostles' amazing gift of tongues (Acts 1). Paul ran down that gift, which had the effect of taking the lustre off the true apostles' gift of tongues. See&nbsp;<a name="marker=464508"></a>1 Cor 14:4-33. Finally, if the Galatians understood the twelve contradicted Paul in any way, Paul would be cursing them in Gal. 1:8-12. He warns the Galatians that even if an "angel from heaven" came with a different Gospel than Paul preached, let him be anathema (<a name="marker=464509"></a>cursed). In light of Paul's comments in chapter two of Galatians, it is fair to infer he meant to warn of even a contradictory message from the twelve and/or James.</span></p>

See Luke 22:19-20. Luke says Jesus' body is `given' but Paul says it is `broken.' This<a name="marker=465230"></a>variance is significant. As&nbsp;<a name="marker=465231"></a>John 19:36 mentions, Psalm 34:20 says not a bone of His shall be broken. Paul's quote is thus contradictory of Luke as well as theologically troublesome. The aphorism is `better to give than receive.' Acts 20:35.</span></p>
