See <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+24%3A5&amp;version=GNV">Isaiah 24:5, GSV</a>.) The Living Bible renders verse 5 with a more contemporary description: "<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The land is defiled by crime; the people have <strong><em>twisted the laws of God</em></strong> and broken his everlasting commands."

For one can repeat a command, but if one says its violation has zero consequences for salvation when God always said otherwise, then we have another reason to find Paul is uninspired -- at least in that teaching.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">However, Paul misquoted Deuteronomy 27:26, giving it a meaning that anyone who transgresses the Law -- even the smallest command -- is cursed. </span></p>

(Galatians 3:10 KJV). (This corruption began with the Septuagint Greek mistranslation of 247 BC that even Jerome in 385 AD refused for this verse to follow in the Latin Vulgate which he rendered.

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Hence, Paul alters the passage by changing "confirm" or "uphold" - a term meaning&nbsp;<strong><em>affirmation</em></strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"> or&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong><em>teaching</em></strong>, and replacing it with a word&nbsp;<strong><em>continueth</em></strong> which implies <strong><em>obedience</em></strong>. &nbsp;Then Paul adds the words<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><em> all things</em> to suggest the slightest disobedience will fall under a curse, rather than the failure to confirm or uphold Torah is cursed. Thus, just a few word <em><strong>changes</strong></em>, and an entirely different meaning was extracted by Paul.</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><br /></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">But in truth, God in Deuteronomy 27:26 curses the one who does not confirm the Law is to be obeyed, whether they perfectly follow it or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Sadly Paul did not realize that God cursed Paul for he "confirmeth not the words of the law to do them," and thus <em><strong>Paul's misquote misled him to do precisely what God promises to curse</strong></em>. And with Paul, so too all the Paulinists who do not "confirmeth the words of this law to do them." As the blind leads the blind, they will all suffer the curse of Deut 27:26. And this is due to their leader -- Paul -- misquoting the very passage that curses them for their contrary teaching.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">This is why Jesus taught those among Christians who teach us to follow the Law are "great" (Matt 5:17-19) rather than cursed, as Paul contrarily teaches. Rather, God curses the one who teaches you not to confirm the law or uphold it to do it. That is Paul's doctrine. How odd Paul cites passages that condemn his teaching, and yet Paul never checks a translation (the Greek Septuagint translation) against the Hebrew original to verify his understanding. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Please also note that Paul&rsquo;s misquote is preceded by denigrating those under the Law as cursed which the verse being quoted supposedly supports: &ldquo;For as many are of the works of the law are under the curse&rdquo; ... which then is followed by the misquote. Thus Paul twisted a verse that curses Paul for his doctrine that does not uphold the Law to obey so instead it supposedly approves Paul&rsquo;s curse-causing view. That is twisting the verse to support the opposite of what it means.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">In <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-12.htm">Galatians 3:12</a>, Paul says: &ldquo;The Law is not based on faith, on the contrary, it says, &lsquo;the person who does these things will live by them.&rsquo;&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s introduction and then slight misquote is twisting <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a> (NASB) which says: &ldquo;So you shall keep my statutes and my judgments, by which a man <strong>may live if he does them</strong>; I am the Lord.&rdquo; Likewise is the Holman translation which reads in key part: &ldquo;a person <strong>will live if he does them</strong>.&rdquo; It does not say the Law is not based on faith in God, as Paul introduces the quote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">What is the verse addressing? Whether the Law is based on faith or not? No. Instead, the original Leviticus text is similar to God&rsquo;s words to Adam and Eve in the Garden where they were told disobedience to God&rsquo;s command would result in death... spiritual death. In Leviticus is the contrasting corollary... a human may live &ldquo;if he does them&rdquo; ...obeys God&rsquo;s Law. In other words, have eternal spiritual life, beginning now and into the future. It is not promising eternal life to those who have no faith in God, as Paul&rsquo;s introduction tries to eviscerate as the foundation of the Law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Yet, Paul clearly twists this to be about the person who assumes the duty to obey will live according to that duty, which Paul introduces as requiring no faith in God to obey at all. So Paul necessarily implies that this cannot be a condition of eternal life, as no faithless person obviously can have eternal life. But in the original, without the introductary remark and the slight twisting, faith was not excluded, and eternal life was in view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Mr. Powers in <a href="http://questioningpaul.com/Questioning_Paul-Galatians-01-Chrestus-Useful_Implement.Paul">Chapter One</a> of Questioning Paul elaborates other meanings in which he sees a similar disparity between Paul in Galatians 3:12 and Leviticus 18:5:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Examining the words (Paul) Sha&rsquo;uwl wrote, we find him quoting (or more correctly, misquoting) the very Torah Christians are wont to deny and separate themselves from:&nbsp;<strong>"The Law exists not out of faith or belief</strong> (<em>pistis</em> &ndash; originally conveyed "trust and reliance" but migrated over time as a result of Paul / Sha&rsquo;uwl&rsquo;s epistles to mean "belief and faith")<strong>, but to the contrary, &lsquo;The one who performs them lives by them.&rsquo;"</strong> (Galatians 3:12) Recognizing that Paul didn&rsquo;t express this thought very well, we must turn to the passage he referenced to ascertain the point he was trying to convey.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Leviticus 18:5 imparts the following Divine instruction:&nbsp;<strong>"Observe</strong> (closely and carefully examine)&nbsp;<strong>My prescriptions and My stipulations. Whoever prepares and accomplishes one&rsquo;s life mission with them, that person is restored to life and lives</strong> (is renewed, nurtured, spared, and kept alive)&nbsp;<strong>in them. I am Yahweh."</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">It appears that Paul has once again abbreviated a passage which is inconsistent with his own message, perhaps hoping that the use of a common word, this time "perform," in conjunction with "the law" would be sufficient to convince his audience that God supports his position.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">But in the quoted verse, God did not say that the "law is very different than faith," or that "through faith a person has life," or anything remotely like that. He said that a careful and close examination of His prescriptions prepares a person for their life&rsquo;s mission, while at the same time, restoring their life. This is once again, the antithesis of the Pauline Christian position.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt; color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Galatians 3:13 versus Deuteronomy 21:23</span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">The Jewish Publication Society translates <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Bible/Deuter21.html">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a> as follows:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">22 And if a man have <em><strong>committed a sin worthy of death</strong></em>, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree; &nbsp;23 his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is <em><strong>a reproach</strong></em> unto G-d; that thou defile not thy land which HaShem thy G-d giveth thee for an inheritance.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">First, notice that Paul in Galatians 3:13 translates what is a "reproach" in the original text, and changes it to be "cursed." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, we read: &ldquo;Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, &lsquo;Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.&rdquo; KJV. Again this began with the Greek Septuagint mistranslation of 247 BC that even Jerome in the Vulgate refused to use. See this <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_XRn7QuMAwMC&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=deuteronomy%2027%3A26%20septuagint&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q=deuteronomy%2027:26%20septuagint&amp;f=false">link</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Second, be aware that for Jesus to atone for sin, Jesus has to be a blameless sheep without blemish. Jesus <em><strong>cannot be actually accursed by God.</strong></em>&nbsp;He did not "commit...a sin worthy of death." Hence, if Deuteronomy 21:22-23 as it correctly reads is applied to Jesus' wrongful execution, then Jesus can atone for sin. This means God does not "curse" Jesus under Deut 21:2-23 as Jesus did not "commit...a sin worthy of death." Jesus can still be our Savior. He is not cursed to hell for our sin in God's eyes, as the word "cursed" would signify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Does Paul lay a trap for the unwary by saying Jesus is viewed by God as one <strong><em>cursed</em> </strong>by God, and that is how sin is lifted from our shoulders -- rather than by the rule of Atonement? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul has said Jesus became a <strong>CURSE</strong> for US as Jesus was cursed instead of us. However, when Atonement covers us, it is by the <strong>INNOCENCE</strong> of the blood poured out by the living being that serves as a COVERING of innocence, like the blood of the lambs on the doorposts protected the Israelites in Egypt, and the angel of death did not touch any of their homes. Atonement is not by treating Jesus as "accursed" by God by virtue of Deut 21:22-23, as Paul quotes, which reproach (or "curse" as Paul changes it to say) never is spoken anywhere in Scripture as the covering of 'innocence' necessary to atone. Quite the opposite is the case. (Incidentally, Paul elsewhere contradicts that the Holy Spirit says Jesus was accursed in our place: &ldquo;Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed....&rdquo; 1 Cor. 12:3.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">However, if Paul is correct that Deut 21:22-23 is talking about Jesus as accursed, then that would render Jesus a sinner who could not atone. <strong><em>Those hung for crimes by their acts could never atone for anything</em></strong>. Only lambs and bulls, etc., who are innocent without blemish or flaw &nbsp;can do so. If Jesus is cursed for being hung on a tree, as Paul construes Deuteronomy 21:23, despite this verse saying it only applies to those who actually "committed a sin worthy of death," and speaks only of a reproach, and not a curse as Paul misquotes, then our salvation solely depends upon whether God will accept Paul's erroneous view that one worthy of a crime of death and who is not an innocent 'Lamb" and then comes under Deut 21:22-23 can become a curse to God, and this is what "atones" -- it somehow appeases God. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Clearly, Paul's idea in Galatians 3:13 runs contrary to our Savior who said at the last supper that his blood is poured out as as "remission" for sin of the whole world. It was not his being hung on a tree that saves souls, by Jesus supposedly being a curse for the curse we deserve. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">There is no such legal principle in the Law. </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, an innocent man paying for a wrong he did not do is what atoned, not Jesus being seen as a CURSE in God's eyes under Deut 21:22-23-- which, if Paul were correct, would leave Jesus as one eternally damned in hell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Mr. Powers in </span><strong><em style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: large; line-height: 1.3em;">Questioning Paul</em></strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"> points out Paul's translation of Deuteronomy 21:23 to speak of a "curse" rather than "reproach" was harmful, and leads to the untenable result that a cursed man in God's eyes could atone for sin. Powers says:</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Moving on to the next verse as it is presented in the King James and New Living Translation, we find: KJV:&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">"Christ hath redeemed us from the <em><strong>curse of the law</strong></em>, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:"</span> (Gal 3:13) If the King James has accurately reflected Paul&rsquo;s thought, then, according to Paul, the Torah is a curse. For this interpretation of Paul&rsquo;s statement to be correct, <em><strong>rather than fulfilling the Torah, Yahshua ransomed us from its clutches</strong></em>. It also means that Yahshua, <strong><em>rather than being the perfect Lamb of God, judged from the perspective of the Torah, embodied all the negativity a "curse" implies</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Absolving Paul of the <em><strong>untenable position</strong></em> he has been placed in by the King James Version, the New Living Translation twists the text to convey a different perspective:&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">"But Christ has rescued us from the curse pronounced by the law. When he was hung on the cross, he took upon himself the curse for our wrongdoing. For it is written in the Scriptures, &lsquo;Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.&rsquo;"</span> (Gal 3:13)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">To the New Living Translation&rsquo;s shame, there is no reference to a "cross" ... in this passage. To Paul / Sha&rsquo;uwl&rsquo;s shame, the Torah verse should not have been abridged nor misquoted out of context. While the Deuteronomy prediction is profoundly accurate, and stunningly prophetic, its merit was mitigated by the way Paul truncated it.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">But first things first: here is how the Greek text of Paul's / Sha&rsquo;uwl&rsquo;s letter reads:&nbsp;<strong>"The Messiyah...</strong><strong>redeemed us from the curse&nbsp;<em>of</em> the Torah, coming to exist as a curse for our sake, because&nbsp;<em>it is</em> written: &lsquo;Accursed&nbsp;<em>is</em> everyone&nbsp;<em>who</em> is hanging upon wood.&rsquo;"</strong> (Galatians 3:13)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, we should reject Paul's view that Deuteronomy says any person hung on the tree is <strong>cursed</strong> by God, whether sinner or not. Instead, our salvation depends upon accepting the Jewish Publication Society's translation -- that such a person is subject solely to being "disparaged, degraded," maligned, and scorned. But cursed? God forbid or we are all lost, including our savior must be bound in hell forever, if Paul is correct.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">So how does Calvin resolve the contradiction? He says because no one higher than Paul exists to tell us the true verse's words and meaning (that is, Paul is <em><strong>supposedly higher than Isaiah</strong></em> -- Yikes!), the contradiction disappears. Calvin writes how we can embellish Paul's words to suit what we think is Paul's intent:</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Literally, however, the Prophet&rsquo;s meaning is: &ldquo;From the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor have they perceived with the ears, hath not seen a god, (or O God,) besides thee, will do (or will prepare) for him that waiteth for him.&rdquo; If we understand&nbsp;(God) to be in the accusative, the relative&nbsp;<em style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, helvetica, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">who&nbsp;</em>must be supplied. This exposition, too, appears, at first view, to suit better with the Prophet&rsquo;s context in respect of the verb that follows being used in the third person;&nbsp;(118)&nbsp;but <strong><em>it is farther removed from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Paul&rsquo;s meaning, on which we ought to place more dependence than on any other consideration</span></em></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span> For <em>where shall we find a surer or more faithful interpreter than</em> the Spirit of God of this authoritative declaration, which He himself dictated to Isaiah &mdash; in the exposition which <em><strong>He has furnished by the mouth of Paul.&nbsp;</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">You can see there is <em><strong>never any Berean testing of Paul</strong></em>. Instead, <em><strong>Paul must win no matter how many prophets he contradicts, laws he abrogates, or insults on God (blasphemies really) he inflicts</strong></em>, Paul is supposedly always right. Absent that cure, Calvin does admit Paul contradicts Isaiah, and no amount of effort at reinterpretation (which he reviewed first whether it was possible) could solve the dilemma. Hence, the only solution left was that Paul supposedly trumps Isaiah!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">The Westminster Larger Catechism reads, &ldquo;No man is able, either of himself, or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">by any grace received in this life, perfectly to keep the commandments of God; but does</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">daily break them in thought, word, and deed&rdquo; (Q. 149).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">This is known as the Total Depravity Doctrine. A reformed Senior Pastor of Messiah's Covenant Community Church in Brooklyn, Steve Schlissel aptly criticized Paul's doctrine of Total Depravity in <a href="http://www.wholebible.com/PdfLibrary/covenantthinking.pdf">Covenant Thinking at the 2002 Auburn Pastor's Conference</a>. (Also at this <a href="http://www.messiahnyc.org/articles.asp?catid=22">link</a> from his church's website.) He writes:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">At Question 25 [of the Westminster Larger Catechism] it reads, &ldquo;The</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">sinfulness of that estate whereinto man fell, consists in the guilt of Adam&rsquo;s first sin, the&nbsp;want of that righteousness whe rein he was created, and the corruption of his nature,&nbsp;whereby he is utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite unto all that is spiritually&nbsp;good, and wholly inclined to all evil, and that continually&hellip;&rdquo; How do the Westminster&nbsp;divines support these statements? Romans 3:10-19 allegedly proved these propositions.&nbsp;We start with these propositions and then go to our versified Bible and find the verses&nbsp;that we think prove our propositions. We pay little attention either to context, argument,&nbsp;or <em><strong>(maybe) contrary texts</strong></em>. We have our verses to prove what we want to believe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Then Schlissel continues:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">The Westminster Confession at chapter 6, section 2, reads, &ldquo;By this sin they fell from their original righteousness in communion with God, and so became dead in sin, and wholly defiled in all the parts and faculties of soul and body.&rdquo; <em><strong>The proof is Romans 3</strong></em>. Now, Romans 3 <em><strong>does not appear directly from heaven without mediation</strong></em>; rather, it appears as part of an argument that the Holy Spirit by Paul is making to a church in a particular historical circumstance. It appears in a section in which Paul is proving that the whole world is made up of sinners. Does that mean that each and every individual is what&nbsp;the confessions here say they are? Let&rsquo;s examine this issue a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Schlissel then says while he does not believe we merit heaven by our own righteousness, it is not proper to use this verse to deny some behave righteously:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">What I am saying is that <em><strong>the way we use the Bible is illegal.</strong></em> We try to make</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">it say things that fit what we believe must be the case in order for our system to hold</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">together, but we don&rsquo;t allow the Bible to speak its own mind. We can see this problem&nbsp;manifested in the sermons that come from Romans 3. Your sweet, Christian grandmother&nbsp;becomes subject<em><strong> to theological abuse as she is told that her throat is an open grave and&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>her tongue practices deceit and the poison of vipers is on her lips.</strong></em> Though she may sing&nbsp;psalms from the time she wakes up until she goes to sleep and devotes hours to prayer for&nbsp;her grandchildren, we are told that she is an evil, wicked witch who is entirely corrupt&nbsp;and no good. This sort of <strong><em>browbeating goes on Sunday after Sunday</em></strong>. Is that really Paul&rsquo;s&nbsp;point?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">I would say using Paul to contradict the inspired Bible is unlawful Biblically. However, Schlissel is arguing we cannot take Paul so literally when the context from which Paul is quoting contradicts the literal meaning of Paul's words. So the solution offered by Schlissel is very much that Paul contradicts the original text, and thus we cannot take Paul's meaning literally. However, I would go further and say that invalidates taking anything Paul says literally, <em>i.e.</em>, <em><strong>Paul is not a valid inspired source of information</strong></em>. Here is what Steven Schlissel says:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">What does Paul intend to say in the book of Romans? &ldquo;There is no one righteous,&nbsp;not even one.&rdquo; Where did he find that idea? He is quoting the Bible, isn&rsquo;t he? Yes, Psalm 14; however,<strong><em> the very psalm in which these sweeping assertions are made we find a&nbsp;remarkable contrary proposition</em></strong>. The psalmist says that all have turned aside and&nbsp;together have become corrupt, there is no one who does good, not even one. &ldquo;Will&nbsp;evildoers never learn? Those who devour my people as men eat bread and who not call&nbsp;upon the Lord? There they are, overwhelmed with dread; for God is present in the&nbsp;<strong><em>company of the righteous</em></strong>.&rdquo; What?<em><strong> Where did &ldquo;the righteous&rdquo; come from</strong></em>? The psalmist&nbsp;just finished saying that there is none righteous, no not one, and the <strong><em>next thing we know&nbsp;there is a whole company of them</em></strong>. How could the writer have missed seeing them&nbsp;before?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Indeed, Schlissel is correct that Psalm 14 says contrary to Paul's conclusion that some are indeed righteous -- a whole bunch are righteous!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Schlissel says that of course Paul did not want to contradict Scripture, and thus concludes:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Is this Paul&rsquo;s&nbsp;summary judgment upon every human being on the planet? Hardly, at least not here, for&nbsp;further in Psalm 5 the psalmist draws a contrast between those who are wicked and those&nbsp;who take refuge in the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">What I find astonishing is Schlissel makes a case that read one way Paul must have known what he was doing. Thus, either Paul is lying, deliberately contradicting scripture, or clearly Paul meant something other than a literal meaning. Listen:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Does anybody think that Paul was so stupid that he didn&rsquo;t know this whole psalm</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">that he was quoting?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">In other words, Paul knew what he was saying, and he knew the literal words were untrue. Thus, Paul must have had a non-literal meaning. Ok, pastor Schlissel, if you say so! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Sometimes I feel like I am Winston Smith in the book <em>1984</em>. &nbsp;I am like Winston -- being told that I must say to the man who is holding up 4 fingers that he is really holding up 5 fingers. (On this passage in <em>1984</em>, see this <a href="http://www.crossroad.to/Excerpts/books/transformation/orwell.htm">link</a>.) Only brainwashing makes the leap. &nbsp;Schlissel effectively turns to in the end relying upon the Pauline mantra of how wise and learned was Paul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Schlissel says in effect 'don't we all know Paul is smart, and would not deliberately contradict scripture. Thus, we must not take Paul literally, word for word.' Ummm. Can we apply this then to all other statements by Paul? If so, no one should rely upon anything Paul has to say! We should also suppose a non-literal meaning when Paul speaks,&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><em>i.e.</em>, we cannot take any of Paul's statements as 100% literal truth.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Schlissel then shows us another misquote and contradiction of Scripture by Paul in the same passage, again to urge us not to take Paul's words so literally:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul&rsquo;s concluding citation at Romans 3:18 uses the words of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/36-1.htm">Psalm 36:1</a>, as he&nbsp;describes the evil men of whom he speaks: &ldquo;There is no fear of God before their eyes&rdquo;;&nbsp;yet, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/36-10.htm">verse 10</a> of the same psalm includes a plea to God: &ldquo;O continue thy loving kindness&nbsp;unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.&rdquo; If verse 1&nbsp;described a universal condition, where did the &ldquo;upright&rdquo; of verse 10 come from?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Schlissel's solution is to pull a rabbit out of the hat, as I call it. Just say something sensible that Paul did not say, and say that "solves" it. So Schlissel says Paul<em><strong> really means</strong></em>&nbsp;by saying 'all have sinned' that even Jews have sinned. The Jews are supposedly not righteous by being Jews. Was that really Paul's only meaning? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I guess if you say so pastor Schlissel, then it must be so. (These 'pastors' get used to people taking their words as gospel. So I think they don't realize we can think independently and reject nonsense. They treat us as petted children who if you hold up 4 fingers and say it is 5, we must believe.) He writes the following:</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">What is the key? The key is that the law was given to the Jews, and when God&nbsp;was speaking to the people here mentioned as being wicked, He was speaking to wicked&nbsp;Jewish people. If there can be wicked Jewish people, no one can be made right with God&nbsp;simply by being Jewish. That is the point Paul intended to prove, and it&rsquo;s the point he has&nbsp;proved. If a person thinks that merely by possessing the Bible he is right with God, then&nbsp;he is mistaken. Look at what it says. It talks about the way Jews behave toward other&nbsp;Jews. Among Jews there are wicked ones and righteous ones, covenant-keeping Jews and&nbsp;covenant-breaking Jews. The mere fact that a man is Jewish does not vindicate him, does&nbsp;not allow him to pass from death to life, and does not guarantee him to inherit anything if&nbsp;he has broken covenant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">What is the most amazing part of this reformed pastor's message is that he then proves the <em><strong>literal words of Paul</strong></em>, and how the WLC has read them to be true, is <em><strong>Biblically false!</strong></em> Bravo! In this next passage, pastor Schlissel writes -- yet never once thinking twice about Paul's validity -- the following:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">The <em><strong>fact is</strong></em> (and I have verses to prove this!) that there are <em><strong>plenty of righteous men&nbsp;and women in the Bible</strong></em>. Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he&nbsp;did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? If God rescued Lot who was a righteous&nbsp;man distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men&hellip; Yes, Lot, a righteous man living&nbsp;among these wicked people, day after day tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless&nbsp;deeds he saw and heard. (I want to hear a preacher from the Netherlands Reformed&nbsp;Church tell me that Lot was a righteous man.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Pastor Schlissel continues with specific examples:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">&ldquo;Dear children do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right is</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">righteous&hellip;&rdquo; (1 John 3:7). There is none righteous, no, not one? The Bible says that there&nbsp;are thousands of them, hundreds of thousands of them, millions of them throughout&nbsp;history. &ldquo;Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother.&nbsp;And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother&rsquo;s were&nbsp;righteous&rdquo; (1 John 3:12).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Pastor Schlissel finds a contradiction in Paul's writings which actually proves something seriously wrong about Paul. Here is what Schlissel quotes as more proof there are righteous people:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">&ldquo;You are witnesses and so is God,&rdquo; Paul writes, &ldquo;of how holy, righteous, and</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">blameless we were among you who believe.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Well, if you put Paul's words side-by-side, one must conclude Paul's behavior was "righteous" but none of his audience can make the claim they are righteous, for Paul says "no, not one is righteous." Hence, Paul alone apparently can do righteous deeds. The rest of us, except Paul, all must be slouches continually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Schlissel then continues with more evidence that Paul contradicts scripture if you read Paul "literally" -- you read it as it reads!</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">James tells us, &ldquo;In the same way was not&nbsp;even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to&nbsp;the spies and sent them off in a different direction?&rdquo; Matthew tells us of Jesus&rsquo; words:</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">&ldquo;And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth from the&nbsp;blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered&nbsp;between the temple and the altar.&rdquo; The Hebrew Bible, which was not organized as ours,&nbsp;began with Genesis and ended with 2 Chronicles. By starting with the first martyr (Abel)&nbsp;and closing with the last martyr (Zechariah), Jesus was making the same statement as our&nbsp;way of saying &ldquo;from Genesis to Revelation&rdquo; (and it just so happens that it is A to Z) From Abel to Zechariah, there were many righteous people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Schlissel keeps battering the divines of Westminster who took Paul's words literally as defying all the Bible other than Paul:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">&ldquo;And you will again see the distinction,&rdquo; Malachi tells us, &ldquo;between the righteous&nbsp;and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not.&rdquo; &ldquo;Because you&nbsp;disheartened the righteous with your lies,&rdquo; Ezekiel tells the false prophets, &ldquo;when I have&nbsp;brought them no grief, and because you encouraged the wicked not to turn from their evil&nbsp;ways and save their lives&hellip;&rdquo; Isaiah says, &ldquo;Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for&nbsp;they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Schlissel then gets a bit blunt that the Westminster Catechism is in breach of the Bible -- yet still never faulting Paul who is indeed the one whose words are at issue:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">People in the<em><strong> church today say that there is none righteous, but God says there are&nbsp;many righteous people</strong></em>. &ldquo;The righteous man leads a blameless life; blessed are his&nbsp;children after him&rdquo; (Prov. 20:7). &ldquo;Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in&nbsp;him; let all the upright in heart praise him!&rdquo; (ps. 64:10). &ldquo;The righteous will flourish like&nbsp;a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon&rdquo; (Ps. 92:12). &ldquo;The scepter of the&nbsp;wicked will not remain over the land allotted to the righteous, for then the righteous&nbsp;might use their hands to do evil. Do good, O Lord, to those who are good, to those who&nbsp;are upright in heart.&rdquo; (Ps. 125:3-4). There is none good, no, not one; yet, we saw in that&nbsp;same psalm that there are people who do good. &ldquo;Those who turn to crooked ways the&nbsp;Lord will banish with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel&rdquo; (Ps. 125:5).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Schlissel is saying when we in the "church today" say that there is none righteous, we contradict God. But replace the words "church today" with Paul, and what do you get as the conclusion? <em><strong>Paul contradicts God Almighty!</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Schlissel then uses artful irony to prove another memorable example of God affirming that he would spare a city as long as there was some righteous present -- an agreement that makes no sense if there is none righteous. Schlissel says:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">&ldquo;Abraham approached God and said, Will you sweep away the righteous with the&nbsp;wicked? What if there are fifty righteous people in this city? Will you really sweep it&nbsp;away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in the city? Far be&nbsp;it from You to do such a thing.&rdquo; Did God reply, &ldquo;There is none righteous, no, not one&rdquo;?&nbsp;No, that is not what He said. God was prevailed upon by Abraham when Abraham&nbsp;prayed, &ldquo;Far be it from You to do such a thing, to kill the righteous with the wicked,&nbsp;treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Schlissel is just getting warmed up, and pulls out even more proofs. I lived under a Reformed church for over a decade. I can tell you that Schlissel knows that proof must be the most conclusive type to ever get a Reformed Christian to question the Westminster. It is almost like an inspired writing among the Reformed (Calvinist) churches. So here is more proof:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Not everyone responds to God&rsquo;s revelation in the same way. Not everyone&nbsp;responds by saying no to God. There are many who by grace say yes to Him, and these&nbsp;are the righteous. &ldquo;Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time,&nbsp;and he walked with God.&rdquo; When Abraham was ninety- nine years old God appeared to&nbsp;him and said, &ldquo;I am God Almighty. Walk before me and be blameless.&rdquo; &ldquo;To the faithful&nbsp;God shows himself faithful; to the blameless he shows himself blameless; to the pure he&nbsp;shows himself pure; but to the crooked he shows himself shrewd.&rdquo; &ldquo;You save the humble&nbsp;but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the land of Uz there lived a man&nbsp;whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright. He feared God and shunned&nbsp;evil. Then the Lord said to Satan, &lsquo;Have you considered my servant Job. There is no one&nbsp;on earth like him. He is blameless and upright. A man who fears God and shuns evil.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">So what is a reformed person's reaction when they realize Paul's literal words are false? Schlissel -- who is saying that reading them literally is false (not Paul) -- has this message that dictate we follow the inspired Scripture rather than the literal meaning of Paul's words:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">These <em><strong>verses are an embarrassment to those who would universalize the statements in&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>Romans 3 and make them doctrines with an independent, theoretical existence in the&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>heavens</strong></em>, but when these persons come down to earth <em><strong>they cannot apply such doctrines.</strong></em>&nbsp;When we come down to earth in real history we find, in fact, both the righteous and the&nbsp;wicked, believers and unbelievers, living together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">After that respite, Schlissel goes back to citing verses to prove<em><strong> the righteous exist</strong></em> and <strong><em>doing righteousnes</em></strong>s are both spoken about everywhere in inspired Scripture:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Solomon said, &ldquo;You have shown great kindness to your servant, my father, David,&nbsp;because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart.&rdquo; &ldquo;Remember, O Lord,&nbsp;how I have walked before you faithfully,&rdquo; Hezekiah said, &ldquo;and with whole-hearted&nbsp;devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.&rdquo; Have we taught our people that they&nbsp;can pray this way if they keep covenant with God? We have cut the legs off our own&nbsp;churches by berating our people and making the attainment and walking in righteousness&nbsp;a theoretical impossibility, whereas in the Scripture it is an everyday reality.&nbsp;&ldquo;Even if these three men&mdash;Noah, Daniel and Job&mdash;were in it, they could save&nbsp;only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Sovereign LORD&rdquo; (Ezek. 14:14).&nbsp;That seems to presuppose that these three men had righteousness. &ldquo;Although he did not&nbsp;remove the high places from Israel, Asa&rsquo;s heart was fully committed to Jehovah all his&nbsp;life.&rdquo; Asa wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but he was perfected. Zecharias and Elizabeth were not perfect,&nbsp;but they were perfected as blameless in obeying the law. &ldquo;Consider the blameless, O&nbsp;God. Observe the upright. There is a future for the man of peace. They are upright in the&nbsp;sight of God. Observing the Lord&rsquo;s commands and regulations blamelessly.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Obviously, Schlissel has no confidence that a reformed believer can dislodge a key plank of Reformed doctrine without such overwhelming proof of the falsity of the literal meaning of Paul's words.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Here is where it gets interesting. Now he claims that to say none are righteous is essentially blasphemous. (Oh Paul! How do people see this but not blame you? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>The Blind shall lead the Blind!</strong></em></span>) For those who have eyes to see, here is pastor Steve Schlissel's great message -- albeit he does not know how great it truly is for those who see the problem:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Paul does not argue or maintain that every single person on the planet is equally&nbsp;wicked. There are converts. <em><strong>To suggest otherwise is to say that God&rsquo;s Word has failed.</strong></em>&nbsp;To say that there are none righteous is to say that everyone is alike and there is no&nbsp;covenant, no antithesis, <strong><em>no efficacy in God&rsquo;s grace</em></strong>. Such a view <strong><em>is nearly blasphemous</em></strong>,&nbsp;for the whole work of God in this world is the bringing of a righteous people unto&nbsp;Himself and setting them off from the world of the wicked to be His and to act like it. He&nbsp;has done this throughout history. At the time of Noah it was slim pickings, but there was&nbsp;one righteous. In Sodom and Gomorrah there was one righteous, and Lot was saved out&nbsp;of it. At most times there have been more than one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">I have to say 'How does pastor Schlissel know that Paul is not being literal, and cannot mean everyone on earth is equally wicked?' How then does Schlissel know that Paul is not responsible for the blasphemy that Schlissel recognizes? Out of charity toward Paul, I will try to find loopholes too, but after a while, we must give up on Paul's messages. He clearly leads us down a dark and ugly path with fine-sounding pseudo-religious arguments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Schlissel exhorts a new day should dawn where we can approve of our righteous friends, and exhort a righteous life is attainable, and teach this as a goal that is possible. He says:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">The effect of this particular twisting of the Scripture has been to <strong>distort the truth</strong>&nbsp;and to put a <strong>blemish</strong> <strong>upon the consciousness</strong> of the people of God. We need to get back to&nbsp;that place where we can speak to the covenant people of God and address them as the&nbsp;righteous of the Lord. They have a place in this world where they are to shine like stars in&nbsp;the night, as they hold forth the word of light. The gathered worshipers on a Sunday, the&nbsp;Lord&rsquo;s Day, are to be built up in what God has made them and called them to be; they are&nbsp;<em style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.3em;"><strong>not to be berated, belittled, stained, doubted, and accused</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Schlissel then gets fired up for a blistering conclusion:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">If we don&rsquo;t agree that we have to go back to our congregations and build them up,&nbsp;then we might as well cash it in now and forget reformation. If we cannot speak to the&nbsp;people of God like God speaks to the people of God,...&nbsp;then<em><strong> we have no right to be ministers of God</strong></em>.&nbsp;If we cannot speak to the congregation of the Lord Jesus Christ as those in whom He&nbsp;lives and dwells and has being in this world as a living testimony, then woe be to us. <em><strong>If all&nbsp;we can do is berate, belittle, and harangue, then we are working at cross purposes with&nbsp;the living God</strong></em> and woe be to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">I can only say Amen! Anyone who continues to preach Paul's words and their literal meaning truly has no right to be ministers of God. Of course, Schlissel did not mean to imply that. However, treating Paul as inspired is truly the cause of the error in the Westminster Catechism. One day we as Christians must eradicate all these wrong ideas, and return to our Savior's message on the topic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;" data-mce-mark="1">Jesus taught in the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats that those who call him Lord and feed and clothe the brethren are the <em><strong>righteous</strong></em> and go to heaven, but those who call him Lord but do not feed and clothe the brethen go to eternal torment where their worm dies not. See Jesus' Words on Salvation, <a href="/books/jesuswordssalvation.html">ch. 11</a>. &nbsp;Shouldn't Jesus be the one Schlissel first examined? Alas Jesus is always told to sit in the back of the bus.</span></p>
