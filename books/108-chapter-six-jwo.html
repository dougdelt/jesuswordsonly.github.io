<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Chapter Six: Paul Contradicts Jesus Over Idol Meat</span></h1>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Introduction</span></h2>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Jesus in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+2%3A6%2C14&amp;version=NIV">Revelation 2:6, 14</a> takes on those persons teaching the Ephesians that it was acceptable to eat meat sacrificed to idols. Among them Jesus says were the Nicolaitans. The Nicolaitans were an actual historical group. They taught Paul's doctrine of grace permitted them to eat meat sacrificed to idols. Jesus commends the Ephesians for refusing to listen to the Nicolaitans on the issue of eating meat sacrificed to idols.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Yet the Nicolaitans were not merely deducing it was permissible to eat such meat from Paul's doctrine of grace. Paul, in fact, clearly teaches three times that there is nothing wrong per se in eating meat sacrificed to idols. (<span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014&amp;version=NIV"><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"></span></a></span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+8%3A4-13&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 8:4-13</a>, and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+10%3A19-29&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 10:19-29</a>. See also, <span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014&amp;version=NIV" style="color: #517291; text-decoration: underline; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 21px; text-indent: 48px;">Romans 14:1-23</a>.</span>)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">However, Jesus, as we will see, three times in Revelation says it is flatly wrong. The Bible says when God commands something, we are not free to "diminish" it by articulating our own exceptions. "What thing soever I command you, that shall ye observe to do: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it." (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut+12%3A32&amp;version=ASV">Deut. 12:32, ASV</a>.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Let's explore thoroughly the origin of this command against eating meat sacrificed to idols. Let's see also the starkness of the contradiction between Paul and Jesus.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><em>Jerusalem Council Ruling on Meat Sacrificed to Idols</em></span></h2>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Acts chapter 15 recounts James' ruling at the Jerusalem Council. The issue presented was whether circumcision was necessary for salvation. The outcome was a decision involving what behaviors Gentiles had to follow as Christians. The first decision was to prohibit Gentiles who wanted to become Christians from committing fornication. The second decision was to prohibit eating meat sacrificed to idols. This principle is drawn from <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus+34%3A13-16&amp;version=ASV">Exodus 34:13-16</a>.<a href="#pgfId=464128" class="footnote" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;"> 1</a></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Paulinists claim that this prohibition on eating meat sacrificed to idols (which was sold in meat markets) was not an absolute command. It was flexible enough to fit Paul's approach. Paul taught idol meat was perfectly acceptable unless someone else thought it was wrong. Paulinists argue that the Jerusalem Council only meant to prohibit eating such meat if it would undermine a weaker brother who thought it was wrong, as Paul teaches.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">However, there is no basis to believe the prohibition in Acts chapter 15 is merely a prohibition on undermining someone else, causing him to violate his conscience. It is clear that eating meat sacrificed to idols is simply wrong in itself. It is also no less absolute a prohibition than the prohibition on fornication. Had the Jerusalem Council ruling intended the eating-idol-meat rule to be only a command to follow during social intercourse, then the council used the wrong words to convey such an interpretation.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">In fact, the prohibition on eating meat sacrificed to idols was stated three times in Acts. It was never once stated with an exception or qualification. There is no hint that eating such meat was permissible in your private meals. In fact, when we later look at Jesus' words in Revelation absolutely condemning such practice, Jesus is talking after Paul's words are written down. Had Jesus intended to affirm Paul's view that eating such meat is permissible, Jesus' absolute directives against ever eating such meat were the wrong way to communicate this. Jesus left no room to find hairsplitting exceptions.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">This absolute prescription first appears at the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15:20. Initially, James decided that "we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols...." (Acts 15:20.) Second, Luke then quotes James' letter to the Gentiles as saying one of the "necessary things" is "you abstain from things sacrificed to idols." (Acts 15:29.) James reiterates this for a third and final time in Acts chapter 21. James is reminding Paul what the ruling was at the Jerusalem Council. He tells Paul that previously "we wrote giving judgment that they [i.e., the Gentiles] should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols...." (Acts 21:25.)</span></p>

It is a flat prohibition like any food law or the prohibition on fornication. As James states the rule, it has nothing to do with rules only at social gatherings. It has no limited application. There is no exception to permit eating idol meat at home.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><em>Jesus' Confirmation of Jerusalem Council Ruling</em></span></h2>

Jesus says "some... hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock (skandalon) before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication." Jesus does not say the error was eating meat sacrificed to idols only if you believed an idol was real. Nor did Jesus say it was wrong only if the person involved thought eating such meat was wrong. Jesus simply laid down a prohibition. Nothing more. Nothing less.Deuteronomy 4:2 prohibits "diminishing" from God's true inspired words by making up exceptions.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">In this Revelation 2:14 passage, the use of the word skandalon is important. In Matthew 13:41-43, Jesus warned that on judgement day all those ensnared (skandalizo-ed) will be gathered by the angels and sent to the "fiery furnace." Hence, Jesus was telling us in Revelation 2:14 that eating meat sacrificed to idols was a serious sin. He called it a skandalon--a trap. It was a salvation-ending trap.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Jesus reiterates the prohibition on eating meat sacrificed to idols in Revelation 2:20. Jesus faults the church at Thyatira for listening to a false Jezebel who "teaches my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols."</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><img src="/chapter 6html-2.gif" alt="" align="RIGHT" />The church at Ephesus, by contrast, is commended by Jesus on this issue. The Ephesians were the ones who tried those who claimed to be an "apostle and are not, but [are] a liar" (Rev. 2:2.)<a href="#pgfId=464171" class="footnote" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;"> 2</a> The Ephesians were also commended for rejecting the Nicolaitans' teaching on idol meat. (Rev. 2:6.)</span></p>

(Rev. 2:14-15.) Jesus thus has commended the church at Ephesus for not only having identified the person who falsely claimed to be an apostle, but also for its having rejected the teaching that it was permissible to eat meat sacrificed to idols. It is no coincidence. The Ephesians' rejection of someone who said he was an apostle but could not be in Rev. 2:2, if this were Paul (see Chapter Ten), would have to go hand-in-hand with the Ephesian's rejection of Paul's doctrine that idol meats were permissible.</span></p>

Robertson (a Paulinist) in <em>Word Pictures</em> confesses the Nicolaitans defended eating such meat based on Paul's gospel:</span></p>

Jesus then condemns twice those who teach a Christian may eat meat sacrificed to idols. Jesus is just as absolute and unwavering on this prohibition as James is in Acts. When Jesus says it, we are not free to "diminish" it by making up exceptions. (Deut. 12:32.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Notice too how three times James in Acts repeats the point. Then three times Jesus repeats the point in the Book of Revelation. (Rev. 2:6, 14 (Ephesus); Rev. 2:14-15 (Pergamum); Revelation 2:20 (Thyatira).) In the New Testament, there is no command emphasized more frequently than the command against eating meat sacrificed to idols.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">This three-times principle, incidentally, is not without its own significance. For Paul says three times that it is permissible to eat meat sacrificed to idols, as discussed next. God wanted us to know for a fact He is responding to Paul.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Paul Permits Eating Meat Sacrificed To Idols</span></h2>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Paul clearly teaches three times that there is nothing wrong in itself eating meat sacrificed to idols. (Romans 14:21;1 Corinthians 8:4-13, and 1 Corinthians 10:19-29.) The first time Paul addresses the question of "eating meat sacrificed to idols," Paul answers: "But food will not commend us to God; neither if we eat not...." (1 Cor. 8:8.) Paul then explained it is only necessary to abstain from eating such meat if you are around a "weaker" brother who thinks an idol is something. (1 Cor. 8:7, 8:10, 9:22.) Then, and only then, must you abstain. The reason is that then a brother might be emboldened to do something he thinks is sinful. The brother is weak for believing eating meat sacrificed to an idol is wrong. This is thus a sin for him to eat, even though you know it is not sinful to eat meat sacrificed to idols. Thus, even though you know better than your weaker brother that it is no sin to do so, it is better to abstain in his presence than cause him to sin against his weak conscience and be "destroyed." (1 Cor. 8:11.) <a href="#pgfId=464223" class="footnote" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">4</a></span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Paul is essentially laying down a principle on how to be considerate of others who think it is wrong to eat meat sacrificed to idols. At the same time, Paul insists as a matter of principle, there is nothing wrong eating such meat. If you were instead the weaker brother, and read Paul's epistles on this topic, you certainly would walk away knowing Paul teaches it is permissible to eat meat sacrificed to idols. You would even think your weak-mindedness on this issue should be abandoned. You should no longer burden your conscience on your brother who refrains due to your overly sensitive conscience. With Paul's instructions in hand, you would certainly know that it is permissible to eat meat sacrificed to idols. You can now get over your undue and ill-founded concern about eating such meat.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">In teaching this, Paul is clearly contradicting James and Jesus. He thereby is "diminishing" Jesus' words by contradicting Him. Paul is prohibiting eating such meat only if someone else is foolish enough to think eating such meat is wrong. Paul has turned Jesus' words on their head. Paul developed a relativistic approach that swallowed the rule. He made the prohibition of none effect. Paul's words clearly violate Deuteronomy 4:2 and 12:32. James and Jesus both say eating meat sacrificed to idols is flatly prohibited and wrong. There are no excuses, hairsplitting qualifications, situational-ethics, or easy outs in deciding whether to obey God. It is wrong and prohibited.</span></p>

This is transparent enough that Pauline Christians admit Paul is saying meat sacrificed to idols is clean and permissible.

First, they apparently share the young Luther's view that the Book of Revelation is noncanonical. Thus, they do not regard Jesus' prohibition on eating meat sacrificed to idols as a hurdle for Paul to overcome. Then what of Exodus' commands (Ex. 34:13-16) designed to prevent eating idol meat? Paulinists defend Paul's position that eating idol meat is permissible by saying the Law was abolished. They then insist this means that any legalistic notion to not eat meat sacrificed to idols was abolished. In fact, these same Paulinists ridicule any first century Christian who would have tried to enforce the command against eating such meats. The Law has been utterly abolished, they explain.</span></p>

There is no law. There are no absolute principles. Your first mistake was to think there are any laws. There is just a question of what is expedient. Eating idol meat is only wrong if it is inexpedient to do so. Eating such meat might set you back in evangelism or offend another Christian. It might become inexpedient temporarily. Otherwise, there are no absolute rules against eating such meat.<a href="#pgfId=464262" class="footnote" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;"> 8</a></span></p>

Pastor Hill would not admonish the one eating the meat. They are OK. He would scold you if you said it was wrong to eat such meat.</span></p>

Jesus is looking at Paul's entire outlook on the Law. Paul's broader message is because there is no Law any longer, it is permissible to eat such meat. Paul, in fact, says James' command in Acts 15:20 against eating such meat is not binding. The Laws of Exodus are not directed to God's people. You apply an expediency test whether to follow it or not. Jesus was the end of the Law, as Paul says. (Rom. 10:4.)</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Jesus' remarks prove Pastor Hill's notion cannot possibly be true. Jesus is angry to the hilt in Revelation 2:6, 14. He is upset that Christians are being told they can commit fornication. He is furious they are told they can eat meat sacrificed to idols. If there is no more strict Law for Christians, and just expediency is the test, then Jesus' words are pointless. We are covered. There is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus. (Romans 8:1.) Jesus apparently had not read that passage. He didn't `learn' its truth. Instead, Jesus is full of condemnation for Christians who violate laws!</span></p>
<p class="BodyAfterHead" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 36pt; margin: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; text-transform: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">In truth, Jesus in Revelation chapter 2 is clearly attacking antinomianism. He is laying down absolutes on fornication and eating meat sacrificed to idols. Jesus is highlighting the error of the Nicolaitans. They were known from Irenaeus' writings to be antinomians. Irenaeus said they believed they could eat any foods. The Nicolaitans taught the Law was abrogated and they lived under grace instead.<a href="#pgfId=464278" class="footnote" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;"> 9</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"> Jesus' attack on antinomianism is also obvious from Jesus' condemnation of the permissiveness on the issue of fornication. Jesus is not only prohibiting fornication at idol worship ceremonies, as a few Paulinists contend. To save Paul's validity, some seriously contend Jesus meant to prohibit fornication only at idolatrous ceremonies. However, no such limitation can be found in the text. The fornication prohibition is stated just as absolutely as the prohibition on eating meat sacrificed to idols. There are no exceptions. There are no plausible hairsplitting arguments that can construe Jesus as only prohibiting fornicating at a pagan ceremony. (If true, it would imply Jesus permitted fornication otherwise.) This spin to save Paul leads to absurdities.</span></span></p>

This includes His command to not eat meat sacrificed to idols. Apostle John has a harsh message for those who claim to know Jesus but who refute His commands. You are a liar when you say you know Jesus. Who else is called a liar by John's pen? The one who told the Ephesians falsely he was an apostle of Jesus. (Rev. 2:2.) We shall see that it is no accident 1 John 2:4 would affix the label liar to Paul for his contradiction of Jesus' command on idol meat. Revelation 2:2 affixes the same label of liar to someone the Ephesians put on trial for claiming to be an apostle and found he was not one. (See the chapter entitled Did Jesus Applaud the Ephesians for Exposing Paul as a False Apostle?)</span></p>

Obviously evil fruit. Jesus says "beware those who come in sheep's clothing." (Matt. 7:15.) What is a sheep in that verse? A Christian. Beware those who come claiming to be a Christian but who have evil fruit. Paul fits both criteria. Jesus then continues, saying even if they come with signs and wonders, He will tell those who work anomia (negation of Mosaic Law) that He never knew them. (Matt. 7:23.)</span></p>

Exodus 34:13 says Jews were to tear down the altars of the Gentiles rather than make a covenant (i.e., a peace treaty). In Exo 34:15-16, God says if you prefer making a covenant and allow their pagan altars, you risk "one call thee [to eat with him] and thou eat of his sacrifice." The command to destroy the pagan altars was so that Jews would avoid eating meat sacrificed to idols even inadvertently at a meal at a Gentile home. This altar-destruction command also had the indirect affect of preventing a Gentile from eating idol meat. For this apparent reason, James in Acts 15:20, 25 and 21:25 prohibits Gentiles from eating idol meat. (On how James construed when the Law applies to Gentiles, see <a href="/chapter 5.#20427" class="XRef" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">See Luther Was Sometimes On the Right Track In This Sermon</a> .) It is ludicrous to argue, as some do, that God was concerned only that one knowingly ate such meat. If true, the Bible could have just prohibited such food as it did with other foods. However, idol meat cannot be identified by appearance. Thus, merely prohibiting eating such meat would not be enough if God was displeased by you eating it unknowingly. Hence, to prevent unknowing eating of such meat, God commands the destruction of pagan altars. Thus, Paul's allowance of eating such meat by not asking questions is precisely what the Bible does not countenance. Rather, if a Jew lived in a society where pagan altars operated and idol meat was sold in the market, the Law intended the Jew not to eat meat whose origin he/she could not be sure about.</span></p>

Paul is thought to teach you should not take communion if one was eating idol meat at a pagan service. In 1 Cor. 10:20-21, Paul says you cannot be partaker of the Lord's table and the "table of devils." This was thus not a flat prohibition on eating idol meat. Most commentators reconcile Paul to Paul by saying Paul means you cannot go to a pagan sacrifice and eat the meat during a pagan service and still partake of communion. There is still thus nothing inherently wrong in eating such meat. In the context in which Paul says this, Paul also repeats his famous axiom, "all things are lawful, but not all things are expedient." (1 Cor. 10:23.) Then Paul says when you buy food or eat a stranger's home, "ask no question for sake of your conscience." (1 Cor. 10:25,27.) Thus, Paul says it is best you not know what you are eating. Don't let your conscience dictate questions about what you are eating. In a sense, Paul believes it is better you not know the meat's origin rather than try to scrupulously avoid eating such meat.</span></p>

Kenneth Loy, Jr. in My Body His Temple: The Prophet Daniel's Guide to Nutrition (Aroh Publishing: 2001) at 69 writes: "Idol Meat Is Clean (Romans 14 and 1 Corinthians 8): God had forbidden idol meat originally because it caused the children of Israel to go `whoring after' the gods of other nations. (Exodus 34:15-16.) Since the Gentiles were now equal in the sight of God, this restriction was no longer necessary. Jewish Christians even preferred idol meat since it was usually less expensive in the market place....Paul stipulates another reason why idol meat is permitted: `As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one....' (1 Corinthians 8:4-6)."</span></p>

If you live by Paul's principles, it is totally acceptable to outwardly behave in a manner that does not offend others, while inwardly you do not have to live and believe those principles. What did Jesus repeatedly say to the Pharisees who reasoned to the same conclusion as Paul?

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">One correspondent argues that Exodus should be construed to only prohibit eating idol meat during a pagan covenant ceremony rather than when invited to eat with a Gentile, as Exodus simply says. The correspondent uses this gloss to limit the otherwise six times Jesus and James state unequivocally a prohibition on eating meat sacrificed to idols. Thus, the correspondent's reading such a limitation without support into these six passages is improper.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Regardless, to be fair, you can read this correspondent's argument and my response at this <a href="/books/554-idol-meat-issue-paul-versus-jesus.html">link.</a></span></p>
