<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The year was 1997. I had been a member of evangeli&shy;cal and Presbyterian churches for a combined 24 years. For many years, I had served as a Sunday school teacher to adults and high schoolers in a 200 member church. I upheld doctrines that I thought were synonymous with following Christ: faith alone and eternal security. I thought Jesus taught the same thing in John 3:16 &mdash; if you believe &ldquo;in me&rdquo; you have eternal life, and John 10:27-29 &mdash; you cannot be snatched from His hand. Thus, of course, nothing Jesus said could ever contradict that doctrine.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">However, all my assumptions on those doctrines were overthrown when I first looked carefully at <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+9%3A42-47&amp;version=ASV">Mark 9:42-47</a>. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">For an in-depth discussion of this passage, see&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><a href="/books/jesusorpaul/146-chapter-3-jwos-heaven-maimed.html">Hell Whole or Heaven Maimed - Chapter Three of Jesus' Words on Salvation.</a><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Afterward, I also carefully re-examined John 3:16 and John 10:27-29, and I found a matching pattern.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">First, in Mark 9, I saw Jesus is talking to the twelve in a house at Capernaum. The twelve were upset that others were preaching Jesus, and casting out demons, but might mis&shy;lead believers in Jesus whom they were appealing to because they were not actually following Jesus and the 12. Jesus starts by discussing the result if anyone misleads one who believes in Jesus:</span></p>

(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+9%3A42-47&amp;version=ASV">Mark 9:42-47 </a>ASV 1901.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Jesus thus taught &ldquo;believers in me&rdquo; including the &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; only have two choices when we sin: we can go to &ldquo;heaven-maimed&rdquo; or &ldquo;hell-whole&rdquo; by failing to strenuously cut off the sources of temptation to sin. In other words, Jesus insisted that sinning believers must have repentance followed by obedience, or else they will enter hell whole.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">This was no isolated passage, I quickly discovered. Jesus says the same thing two more times. These passages are in Matthew &mdash; once in 18:6-9 and again in the Sermon on the Mount at Matthew 5:29-30. I realized that Jesus repeatedly taught this very clear message on salvation addressed to those who &ldquo;<span style="font-weight: bold;">believe in me</span>.&rdquo; I called it the Heaven Maimed or Hell Whole Principle. It is Jesus&rsquo; most repeated message on the salvation principle for those who are already believers.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">I gradually realized there was no avoiding that Jesus said a sinning believer who is caught in a serious sin will not go to heaven absent stern&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">steps</span>&nbsp;of repentance where one&rsquo;s heart turns toward obedience. Clearly, this means there is no eternal security for belief alone, contrary to what I had previ&shy;ously assumed and taught. This also meant Jesus said salva&shy;tion was not guaranteed for faith alone. We had a duty to repent and obey, as well. My long-held beliefs were crushed.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Next, I re-checked my reliance on eternal security in John 10:27-29. I realized Jesus said those who &ldquo;follow&rdquo; and &ldquo;listen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;keep&rdquo; doing so, cannot be &ldquo;snatched from His hands.&rdquo; I somehow previously always misread this (with coaching of those who &ldquo;led&rdquo; me to Christ). I thought I could not be snatched no matter what, once in Christ. I ignored for years the conditions of obeying Jesus upon which that secu&shy;rity depended in John 10:27-29. See&nbsp;</span><a href="/books/jesusorpaul/746-john-10-27-29-security-by-obeying-not-believingjohn-1027-29-is-security-by-obeying-or-believing.html"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">John 10:27-29: Security by Believing or Obedience?&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Thus, that &ldquo;believing&rdquo; had to continue. And it could mean &lsquo;trust&rsquo; and be associated with obedience. Much later, I did a thorough investigation, and found the presence of EIS with PISTEUON meant eternal life should result for the one who was &ldquo;<strong>obeying unto</strong>&rdquo; Jesus, not someone merely &ldquo;believing in&rdquo; Jesus. Had Jesus meant &ldquo;believe in,&rdquo; it would require in Greek that it read &ldquo;PISTEUON EN,&rdquo; not &ldquo;EIS.&rdquo; See&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><a href="/books/jesusorpaul/161-chapter-26-1jwos.html">John 3:16: Does It Say Obeying Unto Jesus Is What It Saves You?</a>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 18pt;">from JWOS Chapter 26.</span></p>

Jesus said the Baptist was the greatest prophet. But wasn&rsquo;t he the last prophet of the &lsquo;Old Covenant&rsquo;? Didn&rsquo;t Jesus supersede John, and now Jesus was explaining to us the faith-alone principles of God that were being set up? Jesus said that kingdom was already within us. But what about this heaven-maimed hell-whole principle which I could no longer ignore? This is Jesus speaking, not John the Baptist.</span></p>

Jesus virtu&shy;ally quotes James&rsquo; Epistle in Revelation chapter three where Jesus says the Holy Spirit is about to depart those whose &ldquo;works&rdquo; are not &ldquo;complete,&rdquo; and are &ldquo;lukewarm&rdquo; followers of Jesus. See Revelation 3.</span></p>

He used the example of not helping the poor, the hungry and the thirsty. I soon noticed that this principle in James identically matched Jesus&rsquo; Parable of the Sheep and the Goats. Those who&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">called&nbsp;</span>Jesus Lord but who fail to feed and clothe the poor are sent to hell, but those who likewise&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">call&nbsp;</span>Jesus Lord yet also feed the poor, clothe the naked, etc., have eternal life.

It appears everywhere in Jesus&rsquo; parables.

I wondered then, as I do now: &lsquo;How did I miss this all these years?&rsquo; It is a&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">shame&nbsp;</span>I missed it for so long. I taught so many people faith alone and eternal security which I&nbsp;<strong><span>thought</span>&nbsp;</strong>Paul authoritatively taught. I came to realize I never had any excuse for teaching faith alone and eternal security. I was going along with the crowd. I was also doing what was easy to get others to happily accept. I knew the costly / change-of-life salvation gospel would not easily win over people, and I mocked it as &lsquo;earning&rsquo; salvation. Then I came to realize I was not listening to all Paul said. As Second Peter says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+peter+3%3A15-17&amp;version=YLT">2 Peter 3:15-17</a>, Paul says many obscure and difficult to understand things &mdash; things that significantly qualify what Paul appears to say without qualification.</span></p>

I now studied, and found that they insist that if you fail to inherit the kingdom, you are still in the kingdom, but you lost rewards there. They claim rewards are a gift. And an inheritance is a gift. Hence not inheriting the kingdom supposedly means losing a gift in heaven but you are still there. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">However, they ignored two things. First, they also taught salvation was a gift we do not earn. So how can they conclude &ldquo;inheriting the kingdom&rdquo; as a reward can not represent salvation? More important, if they were following and listening to Jesus, they would know He said those who &ldquo;inherit the king&shy;dom&rdquo; means they have &ldquo;eternal life.&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt+25%3A34%2C46&amp;version=YLT">Matt. 25:34,46</a>.) &nbsp;Hence, just reading Paul, I should have seen it is not faith alone that guarantees heaven. I was reading Paul in a manner that minimized his conditions on salvation that made salvation disap&shy;pear due to sins I commit, making Paul&rsquo;s gospel easier to believe and promote. I got sucked into the Pauline Gos&shy;pel like almost all of you who are reading this. The Pauline Gospel of today is not what Paul even taught &nbsp;&mdash; at least not consistently.</span></p>

I relied upon John 3:16 to believe in faith alone.<a href="file:///C:/Users/doug/FMOutput/01%20Elder%20Dismissal%20of%20Jesus/Responsive%20HTML5/01_Elder_Dismissal_of_Jesus.htm#FNH_6"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;</span></p>

Luther, the co-founder of Protestantism in 1517 with Carlstadt, said in 1522 that James did not have recognizable inspiration and thus should be viewed as infe&shy;rior to Paul.

I was suspecting that by the same principle I applied to &ldquo;Apostle&rdquo; James as Paul called him (Galatians 1:19), I was going to have to follow Jesus, not Paul, on this issue. I would have to reject Paul&rsquo;s contrary teaching even if Paul were an apostle because of Jesus&rsquo; words that &ldquo;an&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">apostolos</span>&nbsp;is not greater than the one who sent him&rdquo; (John 16:13). This principle applies as much against Paul as I applied it against James to dismiss him beforehand. Hence, I knew unless some explanation applied, I must treat Paul as inferior to Jesus just as I previously treated James that way when the shoe was on the other foot. If my elder saw the con&shy;tradiction, Paul would be as equally invalid on salvation by faith alone as I had once treated James as invalid on salvation.</span></p>

His response was the following:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin: 13pt 18pt 6pt 30px; text-indent: 0pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-family: 'ZapfEllipt BT'; font-size: 11pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">&ldquo;Jesus was speaking to a different dispensation. We are under grace, and once saved always saved applies in the Gospel of Grace.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">I responded:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin: 13pt 18pt 6pt 30px; text-indent: 0pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-family: 'ZapfEllipt BT'; font-size: 11pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">&ldquo;Does this mean we are free to ignore what Jesus taught?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The elder responded in essence that yes, we can ignore these teachings of Jesus. The elder explained, as many others since then have repeated to me, that&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Jesus sent Paul three years after Jesus&rsquo; Ascension with a different gospel than Jesus gave the twelve&nbsp;</span>because Israel had rejected the first Gospel of Jesus. The gospel Jesus gave Paul was suppos&shy;edly entirely re-designed from the gospel Jesus taught the twelve. The new gospel&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">appeals primarily to Gentiles based upon its relaxed nature</span>. It is relaxed so that there are no conditions except faith alone. This Paul-Gospel of Grace supposedly replaced the gospel Jesus gave the twelve. The new gospel was designed to allow Gentiles to enter without any works of repentance, good works, etc; they only needed to believe that Jesus died for their sins and resurrected, as Paul taught in 1 Cor. 15:1-4.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">I did not know then this was a formalized doctrine known as Dispensationalism among Evangelicals, and Cove&shy;nant Theology among Calvinists.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">All I immediately thought at the time is how odd that we could just get rid of all the four gospels essentially, and extract out bits that might match Paul, particularly from John, and then preach that. Yet, I did not challenge the elder. I went home and studied.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">What gnawed at me, and should any Christian, is that there is supposedly&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">two different gospels</span>&nbsp;in the "New Testa&shy;ment." One so displaces the other that you would supposedly do no harm to yourself if you did not read anything Jesus said in the four gospels. You just have to believe Jesus died for your sins and rose from the dead, and Paul says &ldquo;you shall be saved.&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:1-10.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">I know I taught this for years. However, I never real&shy;ized what was being marginalized in preaching: the full scope of what Jesus truly taught on salvation.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Now I began to ponder whether we should be ignor&shy;ing Paul, and whether I was wrong previously to ignore James. But if we ignore Paul, I was asking myself whether we would be ignoring many quotations of Jesus given by revela&shy;tion to Paul? If Paul quoted Jesus often, I thought that would be troublesome to ignore Paul. So I researched this question: &lsquo;What is the cost to Jesus&rsquo; words if we treat Paul just like Luther told us to treat &ldquo;Apostle&rdquo; James, the brother of Jesus?&rsquo;<a href="file:///C:/Users/doug/FMOutput/01%20Elder%20Dismissal%20of%20Jesus/Responsive%20HTML5/01_Elder_Dismissal_of_Jesus.htm#FNH_10"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;Luther told us to ignore the epistle of &ldquo;Apostle&rdquo; James (as Paul identified him as an apostle in Galatians 1:6) for contradicting Paul. What must we do if we discover it is the other way around: that it is Paul who contra&shy;dicts Jesus and must be ignored?</span></p>
<h1 dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 17pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 0pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Paul Never Quotes A Revelation to Himself of A Teaching of Jesus</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Fortunately, I realized quickly there is no conse&shy;quence on Jesus&rsquo; teachings if we entirely ignore Paul. For Paul teaches many doctrines in all his epistles. However, he does so&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">without ever quoting Jesus</span>&nbsp;giving him the specific message that Paul was teaching.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">First, Paul does not give any teachings in his epistles that quote Jesus from the Gospels to support a teaching of Paul. In fact, Paul&rsquo;s only verifiable quote from Jesus in the Gospels is the Communion Liturgy &mdash; Jesus&rsquo; words at the Last Supper. Paul repeats these words, and offers no explana&shy;tion given to Paul by revelation from Jesus about their mean&shy;ing. Hence, by dismissing Paul, we lose no quotes of Jesus uniquely from Paul that explains&nbsp; Jesus&rsquo; words that also appear in the Gospels.<a href="file:///C:/Users/doug/FMOutput/01%20Elder%20Dismissal%20of%20Jesus/Responsive%20HTML5/01_Elder_Dismissal_of_Jesus.htm#FNH_11"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;</span></p>

This quote too was not apparently to support a teaching. Also, it was an extremely odd revela&shy;tion, to say the least. This is when Paul&rsquo;s Jesus refuses to release Paul from a torment of an &ldquo;Angel of Satan&rdquo; so that Paul learns humility.<a href="file:///C:/Users/doug/FMOutput/01%20Elder%20Dismissal%20of%20Jesus/Responsive%20HTML5/01_Elder_Dismissal_of_Jesus.htm#FNH_12"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;The Jesus of the Damascus Wilder&shy;ness tells Paul that &ldquo;my grace is sufficient for thee.&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:7.) In other words, Paul&rsquo;s Jesus says &lsquo;I have already shown you enough favor&rsquo; (grace). These words expressed a refusal to show Paul any more grace. There is no teaching in these words that Paul then expounds upon.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">So there is no doctrine which Paul teaches that he sup&shy;ports by quoting a revelation given to him directly by Jesus.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Was my elder justified in so easily disregarding Jesus&rsquo; teachings at odds with Paul&rsquo;s teachings? Must we follow Paul&rsquo;s teachings when they contradict Jesus when Paul does not even cite a revelation from Jesus in support? Where did this notion come from that there are two different gospels in the "New Testament?" And how can Paul&rsquo;s gospel supposedly sup&shy;plant Jesus&rsquo; gospel? </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; word-spacing: 0.25em; font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0em;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">In time, I learned of the doctrine of dis&shy;pensationalism and its twin, Covenant Theology. These views teach that first supposedly was the Gospel to the circumcision. This allegedly reflects the entire scope of Jesus&rsquo; teachings heard by the twelve. However, this gospel was supposedly withdrawn by God when it was allegedly rejected by the Jews. (This is untrue, proven by Acts 21 where James tells Paul many "myriads" &mdash; tens of thousands &mdash; of Jews had come to follow Christ.) Then there was supposedly a second gospel which replaced the first, but this time extended to both Jews and Gentiles. This was the Gospel of Grace from Paul. But the question remained: &ldquo;How and when did evangelical Christianity come up with the notion to follow solely the gos&shy;pel of Paul, despite even being aware that it contradicted Jesus? Despite Jesus&rsquo; last words before Ascending being: &ldquo;<strong>teach the nations everything I commanded you</strong>?&rdquo;</span></p>

Or whether Paul supplanted Jesus&rsquo; teachings? The question I found is who do we follow &mdash; Jesus or Paul?</span></p>

Paul cites &ldquo;Scripture&rdquo; that says a &ldquo;worker is worthy of his wage.&rdquo; This paraphrases Deuteronomy which says substantively the same thing. Paul does not say he is quoting Jesus. Because Jesus was para&shy;phrasing Deuteronomy too, there is not enough support to prove Paul was doing anything more than what Jesus was doing.</span></p>
