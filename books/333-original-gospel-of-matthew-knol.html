<h1><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">The Original Gospel of Matthew</span></strong></h1>
</div>
<div class="knol-inline-editor knol-content-ltr">
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">This is a reprint of the<em> Knol Encyclopedia</em> entry by Standford Rives, which Knol project was discontinued in March 2012 by Google</span></p>
<h2 class="knol-subtitle" title="Click on the &quot;Edit this knol&quot; button to switch to edit mode and change this field."><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>What Matthew Looked Like Prior to The Greek Traditional Text&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
</div>
<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">&nbsp;<span data-mce-mark="1">The Apostle Matthew originally wrote his Gospel in Hebrew. Of the Hebrew Matthew there is no doubt, although few Christians are aware of this. The original Hebrew version was maintained by a group known as the Ebionites. An Aramaic translation in Hebrew lettering was preserved by the Nazarenes later in conjunction with the Hebrew version. Jerome confirms this latter fact.</span></span></div>
<div class="knol-inline-editor knol-content-ltr">
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The Nazarenes also made a Greek translation, but this is not the same as our traditional Greek text. Jerome made a translation into Latin and Greek of the Nazarene version in Hebrew text. However, despite his referring to this translation several times, the Catholic Church failed to preserve Jerome's two translations. In the two dozen quotes by Jerome himself from his translation of the Hebrew Matthew found in his commentaries, we find the variants are slight yet interesting. Sadly, Jerome's translation disappears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Then a Hebrew version of Matthew known as the Shem Tob emerged in the middle-ages. Professor Howard of Mercer University recently published this edition. It has clues that it traces back to the original true gospel of Matthew. This version ironically was preserved in a Jewish critique of Matthew as an appendix to the critique. It was used to point to flaws in Christianity. Yet, it actually repairs a mis-citation in the Greek version upon which we rely that has Jesus saying the 30 pieces of silver prophecy was in Jeremiah. The Hebrew Matthew which Professor Howard brought to light has Jesus correctly citing Zechariah (which correction to Zechariah also appears in the variants mentioned by Jerome in the 400s was found in the original Hebrew Matthew). Thus, on its face, the version of the Hebrew Matthew known as the Shem-Tob which Professor Howard brought to light was not likely skewed to embarass Christianity. All the differences are relatively minor yet again are interesting. Hence, the Hebrew Matthew is a legitimate alternative source of variants to consider in repairing inadvertent copy/translation errors.</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">1. Introduction</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Edward Gibbon wrote of a tradition that preceded the Greek editions of Matthew that form our current English New Testament. Gibbon wrote: "But the secret and authentic history has been recorded in several copies of the&nbsp;<em>Gospel according to St. Matthew</em>, which these sectaries long preserved in the<strong><em> original Hebrew</em></strong>, as the sole evidence of their faith..." (Gibbon,&nbsp;<em>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em> (1837) at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Hy8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA778&amp;ots=PGkLYsSs4k&amp;dq=secret%20and%20authentic%20history%20has%20been%20recorded%20in%20several%20copies%20of%20the%20Gospel%20according%20to%20St.%20Matthew%2C%20which%20these%20sectaries%20long%20preserved%20in%20the%20original%20Hebrew%2C%20as%20the%20sole%20evidence%20of%20their%20faith&amp;pg=PA778#v=onepage&amp;q=secret%20and%20authentic%20history%20has%20been%20recorded%20in%20several%20copies%20of%20the%20Gospel%20according%20to%20St.%20Matthew,%20which%20these%20sectaries%20long%20preserved%20in%20the%20original%20Hebrew,%20as%20the%20sole%20evidence%20of%20their%20faith&amp;f=false">778</a>.) As of 1837, Gibbon could say the Hebrew Matthew is "most unaccountably lost."&nbsp;<em>Id.</em>, at 778 fn. 5. This may no longer be the case, for two reasons.</span></p>
</div>
<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">First, Scholarly digging or "text excavation" has found dozens of variants mentioned during 100-400 by early church commentators wherein a significant restoration of the Hebrew Matthew is possible. Finally, we may be able to see a glimpse of the Hebrew Matthew through the medieval text of the Hebrew Matthew attached to the &nbsp;Shem-Tob text, as discussed below.</span></div>

<h4><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">2. Proof of An Original Version of Matthew in Hebrew / Hebrew Text</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The following are the many examples that supports Gibbon's statement about a Hebrew version of Matthew. </span></p>

Let us go and be baptized by him.&rsquo; But Jesus said to them, &lsquo;in what way have I sinned that I should go and be baptized by him? Unless perhaps, what I have just said is a sin of ignorance.&rsquo;&rdquo; And in the same volume, &ldquo; &lsquo;If your brother sins against you in word, and makes amends, receive him seven times a day.&rsquo; Simon, His disciple, said to Him, &lsquo;Seven times in a day!&rsquo; The Lord answered and said to him, &lsquo;I say unto thee, until seventy times seven.&rsquo; &rdquo; (Jerome, <em>Against Pelagius</em> 3.2)&nbsp; [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentic_Gospel_of_Matthew">Wikipedia</a>].</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The matter in debate, therefore, or I should rather say your opinion regarding it, is summed up in this: that since the preaching of the gospel of Christ, the believing Jews do well in observing the precepts of the law, i.e. in offering sacrifices as Paul did, in circumcising their children, as Paul did in the case of Timothy, and keeping the Jewish Sabbath, as all the Jews have been accustomed to do. If this be true, we fall into the heresy of Cerinthus and<strong> Ebion</strong>, who, though believing in Christ, were anathematized by the fathers for this one error, that they&nbsp;<strong>mixed up the ceremonies of the law with the gospel of Christ</strong>, and professed their faith in that which was new, without letting go what was old. Why do I speak of the<strong> Ebionites,</strong> who make pretensions to the name of Christian? In our own day there exists a sect among the Jews throughout all the synagogues of the East, which is called the sect of the Minei, and is even now condemned by the Pharisees. The adherents to this sect are known commonly as&nbsp;<strong>Nasarenes</strong>; they<strong> believe in Christ the Son of God, born of, the Virgin Mary; and they say that He who suffered under Pontius Pilate and rose again, is the same as the one in whom we believe</strong>. But while they desire to be both Jews and Christians, they are neither the one nor the other. I therefore beseech you, who think that you are called upon to heal my slight wound, which is no more, so to speak, than a prick or scratch from a needle, to devote your skill in the healing art to this grievous wound, which has been opened by a spear driven home with the impetus of a javelin. For there is surely no proportion between the culpability of him who exhibits the various opinions held by the fathers in a commentary on Scripture, and the guilt of him who reintroduces within the Church a most pestilential heresy. If, however, there is for us no alternative but to receive the Jews into the Church, along with the usages prescribed by their law; if, in short, it shall be declared lawful for them to continue in the Churches of Christ what they have been accustomed to practice in the synagogues of Satan, I will tell you my opinion of the matter: they will not become Christians, but they will make us Jews.&nbsp;<span data-mce-mark="1"><em>(Jerome, CE 404, Letter 75 - Jerome to Augustin</em>)</span></span><br /><br /></blockquote>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Aramaic-Priority Myth</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"><span data-mce-mark="1">One of the main arguments against belief in a Hebrew Matthew is that scholars prior to the discovery of the Dead-Sea Scrolls convinced themselves that in Christ's time everyone spoke Aramaic on a daily basis, and hence Matthew would not have written in Hebrew. These scholars believed Hebrew was supposedly a dead language. Thus, they ask how could a gospel be written in Hebrew? For example, Gustaf Dalman in his work&nbsp;<em>The words of Jesus considered in the light of post-Biblical Jewish writings</em> (1902) at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=54BCAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=dalman%20the%20words%20of%20jesus&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=lintel&amp;f=false">56</a> summarily dismisses any notion of a Hebrew original of Matthew because everyone supposedly knows no one spoke Hebrew anymore in Christ's time:</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The existence of a primary gospel [of Matthew] in the Hebrew language has to be considered antecedently improbable, because no ocassion was discovered for the use of this language.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Dalman goes so far as to preposterously disavow the importance of all of Jerome's positive statements, and then cast a baseless doubt that Jerome held his belief in a Hebrew Matthew to the end: "it may now be regarded as an established fact that Jerome was mistaken, and that he himself latterly perceived his error in believing that the original of Matthew in Hebrew still existed in his day." (<em>Id.</em>, at<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=54BCAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=dalman%20the%20words%20of%20jesus&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=lintel&amp;f=false"> 57</a>.)</span></p>

<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"><span data-mce-mark="1">However, nothing at all supports that claim about Jerome backing off from his full support that the Hebrew he found in the Hebrew Matthew appeared the original text. Dalman makes this claim despite Dalman acknowledging Jerome questioned the Greek translation which says a 'veil' at the Temple was instead of a lintel. Jerome believed it was a Greek translator's error now that Jerome had seen the<strong><em> Hebrew Matthew</em></strong>. Jerome recognized the Hebrew Matthew said a lintel fell, not a curtain was rent at the Temple. And the<strong><em> Hebrew</em></strong> word for&nbsp;<em>lintel</em> is virtually identical in appearance to&nbsp;<em>curtain</em>. Hence, a Greek translator could easily make a mistake which mistake can be cleared up by examining the Hebrew Matthew. (Dalman,&nbsp;<em>id.</em>, at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=54BCAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=dalman%20the%20words%20of%20jesus&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=lintel&amp;f=false">56</a>.) Dalman mentions this but then brushes it aside as unimportant to establish Jerome's belief in a Hebrew original. Nor does Dalman ever establish Jerome lost faith that the Hebrew was more original. Dalman's book, as we examine it, is highly polemical and one-sided in its analysis -- all designed to discount anything but our Greek texts.</span><span data-mce-mark="1"></span></span></div>

<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">A further example of the disregard for a Hebrew Matthew beginning over 100 years ago is Nicholson's work of 1879 entitled&nbsp;<em>The Gospel according to Matthew. </em>He takes it for granted that the Hebrew Matthew was actually written in Aramaic. He does so despite Jerome quoting&nbsp;<em>mahar</em> as a Hebrew, not Aramaic, word, that means&nbsp;<em>tomorrow</em> so as to highlight the variance in the Lord's prayer over "daily bread" versus "tomorrow's bread" in the Hebrew Matthew. He does so despite Jerome's pondering how the Hebrew of&nbsp;<em>lintel</em> can be misread as&nbsp;<em>curtain</em>, surely indicating he is looking at a <em><strong>Hebrew</strong></em>, not Aramaic, text.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"><span data-mce-mark="1">What these scholars erred in is (a) just because Aramaic was spoken daily did not mean Hebrew was dead; and (b) just because Aramaic was spoken daily did not mean Jesus did not speak sometimes in Hebrew, especially in the synagogue and in religious discussions. The Shem-Tob gives us some idea of when Jesus would speak Hebrew. From the cross, Shem-Tob says Jesus spoke in the "holy language" His cry to God "Elohim, Elohim," etc. Thus, for moments of religious significance, Jesus spoke in Hebrew.</span><span data-mce-mark="1"></span></span></div>

<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The Aramaic Priority Myth began to crumble with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The scrolls showed vibrant communities within Judaism writing in Hebrew in the 200 years leading up to Christ, and according to Eisenman and the Dead-Sea-Scrolls-tour, up through the entire early epoch of 70 AD.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"><span data-mce-mark="1">Fischer pointed out that these scholars missed this well-known passage of Scripture in the Book of Acts dealing with Paul's arrest by the Romans and his defence before the Jews:</span>&nbsp;</span></div>

</div>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">"And when he (the chief captain) had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs. ... And there was a great silence, he&nbsp;<strong><em>spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue</em></strong>. ... And when they heard that he<strong><em> spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them</em></strong>, they kept the more silence" (Acts 21:39 through Acts 22:2).&nbsp;</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">How could this be true if Hebrew was a dead language? The audience understood Hebrew, and not just the speaker. Obviously, Paul used Hebrew when a religious purpose was involved, just like the Shem-Tob reveals Jesus did in His last words on the cross, referring to Jesus speaking in the "Holy language."</span></div>

In it, J.C.L. Gibson wrote, "No doubt that Jews of the homeland continued to speak Hebrew in the everyday life still in the Christian epoch - otherwise how can we explain the emergence of the late form of Hebrew known as Mishnaic Hebrew?"</span></div>

Therefore these two forms exist, &ldquo;Out of Egypt have I called my Son,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;For He will be called a Nazarene.&rdquo; (See also margin of codex 1424 &ndash; This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophets, &ldquo;Out of Egypt have I called my Son.&rdquo;) (Jerome, On Illustrious Men 3) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentic_Gospel_of_Matthew">Wikipedia</a>]</span></blockquote>

And the Lord said, &ldquo;How can you say, I have fulfilled the law and the prophets, when it is written in the law: You shall love your neighbor as yourself and many of your brothers, sons of Abraham, are covered with filth, dying of hunger, and your house is full of many good things, none of which goes out to them?&rdquo; And he turned and said to Simon, his disciple, who was sitting by Him, &ldquo;Simon, son of Jonah, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the rich to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; (Origen, Commentary on&nbsp;<strong>Matthew</strong> 15:14) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentic_Gospel_of_Matthew">Wikipedia</a>]</span></blockquote>

<span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"> In Matthew 5:22, many Greek texts read "angry with his brother&nbsp;<em>without a cause</em>...." In Gospel Codex 1422, it has marginal notes of the variants in what it calls the 'Jewish gospel"&nbsp;<em>i.e.</em>, To Ioudaikon.

<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Another variant is in Matthew 12:40. According to Codex 899, instead of Jonah being "three days and three nights" in the belly of the whale, and so would be the "Son of Man would be three days and three nights in the grave," the words "three days and three nights" are not present in the "Jewish Gospel." It says: "The Jewish gospel does not read three days and three nights."(Hans-Josef Klauck,&nbsp;<em>Apocryphal Gospels</em> (2003) at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WoqXMHPY5EgC&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=jerome%20matthaeum&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q=jerome%20matthaeum&amp;f=false">48</a>.)

<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"><span data-mce-mark="1">Another variant is for Matthew 27:65. One of the codices mention a gloss from the "Jewish gospel" reads:</span>&nbsp;</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">And he [Pilate] delivered to them armed men that they might sit over against the cave and guard it day and night.&nbsp;(Hans-Josef Klauck,&nbsp;<em>Apocryphal Gospels</em> (2003) at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WoqXMHPY5EgC&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=jerome%20matthaeum&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q=jerome%20matthaeum&amp;f=false">48</a>.)&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Another variant was used by Jerome without attribution to the Jewish gospel, but the codices mention in the margin how the "Jewish gospel" &nbsp;has a reading that matches what Jerome quotes in&nbsp;<em>Adversus Pelagiano</em> 3:2. This is Matthew 18:21f:'&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Yes, I say to you up to seventy times seven.<em> <strong>For even in the prophets after they were annointed with the Holy Spirit, (the) word&nbsp;of sin was found.</strong> </em>(Hans-Josef Klauck,&nbsp;<em>Apocryphal Gospels</em> (2003) at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WoqXMHPY5EgC&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=jerome%20matthaeum&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q=jerome%20matthaeum&amp;f=false">48</a>.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"> The meaning of this, Klauck points out, is that despite having the holy spirit, these men too had to keep repenting of sin.

<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Variants Noted by Nehemiah Gordon</span></h2>
<span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Nehemiah Gordon wrote a book&nbsp;<em>Hebrew Yeshua vs. Greek Jesus</em> (Jerusalem: 2006). Gordon, a Jewish scholar familiar in Biblical Hebrew, was asked, he explains, by a Christian to help decipher the Hebrew Gospel of Matthew published by Professor Howard. Gordon read the gospel, and became impressed by Jesus as sharing Gordon's own Karaite doctrine which was to reject man-made additions to the Law and Prophets.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In the course of looking at the original text, he found differences between Howard's English rendering and the Hebrew text that Howard provided. There were more than one Hebrew copy that Howard worked from so this may explain the discrepancy. Regardless, Gordon provided a few extra variants that are not evident reading Professor Howard's English translation but which Gordon explains makes perfect sense.</span></div>

<h3><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">1. Taking An Oath Falsely, Matthew 5:33</span></h3>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Gordon examined the original Hebrew text upon which Professor Howard relied in his 1987 publication of the Hebrew Gospel of Matthew. Gordon discovered that the Greek translation of Matthew 5:33 inadvertently dropped the word "falsely" from the Hebrew Matthew of 5:33. This omission erroneously made it appear Jesus said one is never to take an oath. (Nehemiah Gordon,&nbsp;<em>Hebrew Yeshua v. Greek Jesus</em> (Hilkia Press, 2006) at 59, 65-66, 68.)</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Gordon explains why "falsely" is the obviously right reading. First, Gordon admires the excellence of Jesus's understanding of the Law, and thus one would not anticipate Jesus meant a follower should never take an oath. Gordon points out God commands people to take oaths in God's name. "Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God;... and by his name shalt thou swear." (Deu 10:20 ASV.)</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Gordon notes the Pharisees taught, by contrast, you could violate an oath as long as not sworn in Yahweh's name. The Pharisees deduced this from a hypertechnical reading of the Bible passage which prohibited any false swearing in<strong><em> God's name</em></strong>. (Lev. 19:12.)</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">By examining Jesus' criticisms, Gordon said one can deduce how the Pharisees twisted this verse, and hence the point of Jesus in the Hebrew Matthew perfectly fits. Jesus said we are not to make any "false" oath, according to the Hebrew Matthew. From what Jesus said, the Pharisees obviously said Leviticus 19:12 implied<strong><em>you could falsely swear</em></strong> even if you invoked objects closely associated with God, like the Temple. You supposedly would transgress the command&nbsp;<strong><em>only when God's name is used</em></strong>.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">However, Jesus was invoking the broader principle in Zechariah 8:17 which said "love no&nbsp;<strong><em>false</em></strong> oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith Jehovah." Thus, Jesus was saying you were not allowed to dupe others by a false oath if you worded your oath carefully not to use God's name. Jesus was prohibiting any "false" oath, as Zechariah says, and rejecting one could make a false oath as long as not in God's name,&nbsp;<em>e.g.</em>, "I swear by the gold in the Temple.'</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, the Pharisees diminished the Law once more, and this was what Jesus's theme was throughout the Sermon on the Mount. Gordon detected the difference in the Hebrew version of Matthew where Jesus corrected them, saying `do not swear&nbsp;<strong><em>falsely</em></strong> at all,' whether by the temple or anything else. The Greek translation dropped the word<strong><em> falsely</em>,&nbsp;which has led some Christian sects to advise their members to not even take an oath in a court of law</strong>.</span></div>

<h3><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">2. Matthew 23:2-3 - A "He" in Hebrew Was Altered To "They" in Greek, With An Anomolous Result&nbsp;</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In this passage, Jesus in the Greek text tradition of Matthew tells His followers to do everything the Pharisees tell them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">(2) Saying "The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: &nbsp;(3) All therefore whatsoever<strong><em> they</em></strong>bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not." (Matt.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2023:2-3&amp;version=KJV">23:2-3</a>, KJV)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">But Jesus had often said the Pharisees made of "none effect" the Law by their traditions (Matt. 15:6), and they put burdens on the people that are too difficult to bear which are not in the Law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Thus, Christian scholars concur there is something wrong and implausible in this statement attributed to Jesus. J.C. Fenton says "It is really&nbsp;<strong><em>difficult to believe Jesus commanded obedience</em></strong> to the teaching of the scribes and Pharisees." (J.C. Fenton,&nbsp;<em>Saint Matthew</em> (Pelican: 1963) at 366.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Of the same opinion are&nbsp;W.D. Davies and Dale C. Allison, Jr. in&nbsp;<em>Matthew</em> (T&amp;T Clarke: 2000) at 270.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Fenton speculates a pro-Pharisaical party made this addition to Matthew's Gospel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">But it turns out if "they" was "he," then the verse makes perfect sense with other statements made by Jesus. Jesus would be saying you are to follow what "he" -- Moses -- says -- but not follow 'them' - the Pharisees. This is the same message in Matthew 5:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">And we find this "he" is what the Hebrew Gospel of Shem Tob that Professor Howard unearthed in 1987, as Nehemiah Gordon read the Hebrew. The Hebrew Shem-Tob Gospel has "he" instead of "they," providing thus obviously the right reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Here is how Nehemiah Gordon corrected this passage:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">&ldquo;The Pharisees and sages sit on Moses&rsquo; seat. Therefore, all that&nbsp;<strong>he</strong>* [i.e., Moses] says to you, diligently do, but according to their reforms [<em>i.e.</em>, additions] and their precedents [i.e., examples used to justify conduct], do not do because they talk but they do not do [Torah].&rdquo; Hebrew Matt. 23:2-3 (translation by Nehemiah Gordon).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">*In the Greek Matthew, it says &lsquo;all that they say, do.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Nehemiah Gordon pointed out that this comports with the Christian commentators who find it anomolous that Jesus would instruct Christians to obey the Pharisees:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Most Christian scholars simply admitted that Yeshua<strong><em> could not have meant for his disciples to obey the Pharisees but were unable to offer any plausible explanation</em></strong> of the fact that the book of Matthew attributes these words to him. (Nehemiah Gordon,&nbsp;<em>The Hebrew Yeshua vs The Greek Jesus</em> (Jerusalem: Hilkiah Press, 2006) at 30.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong>Ebionite Matthew</strong></span></h2>
<span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Ehrman suggests that the early Ebionites may have translated Matthew in Aramaic. Ehrman agrees that the Ebionites had a version of Matthew in Hebrew. This version may have been identical to a version by the Nazarenes, which was a name sometimes used for Jewish Christians like the Ebionites were. See Ehrman's discussion at this google.books&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PZl-VrRup64C&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;ots=oQ19PzX_zv&amp;dq=I%20have%20begotten%20you%20aramaic%20gospel&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20have%20begotten%20you%20aramaic%20gospel&amp;f=false">link.</a> The most likely resolution is that Matthew wrote in Hebrew in Hebrew lettering, and this is the authentic first version. The second, also by Matthew, would be the Aramaic translation in Hebrew lettering. This accounts for both being ascribed to Matthew, the apostle.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Ehrman has the theory that the Ebionites wrote a version of their Gospel in Greek. See this&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PZl-VrRup64C&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;ots=oQ19PzX_zv&amp;dq=I%20have%20begotten%20you%20aramaic%20gospel&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20have%20begotten%20you%20aramaic%20gospel&amp;f=false">link</a>.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">This appears confirmed by Jerome who mentions a Greek translation done by the Ebionites of Matthew's Gospel. This is not the same gospel as the later Greek version that became our common Matthew of today. There is an example of where the Ebionite Greek spoke of "cakes" as the food of John the Baptist, but this was translated into "locusts" in the traditional Greek edition of Matthew by the alteration of a single letter. Thus, this helps identify the Ebionite Greek version as distinct from the traditional Greek edition.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">For more on the Ebionites, see the collection of materials at this&nbsp;<a href="http://knol.google.com/k/zia-shah/ebionites-diversity-of-the-early/1qhnnhcumbuyp/182">knol</a>.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">According to the Church Fathers, the&nbsp;<strong>Athentic Gospel of Matthew</strong> or the&nbsp;<strong>Gospel of the Hebrews</strong> was authoritative and apostolic in nature.&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papias" title="Papias">Papias</a> quoted by&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus" title="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a> tells us that the Apostle Matthew wrote it in "Hebrew letters."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Eusebius adds that the reason Matthew wrote his version was that he was about to leave the religious community he established, and therefore put together an account of the life of Jesus for the people he left behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphanius" title="Epiphanius">Epiphanius</a> confirms the aforementioned, and goes on to say that Matthew alone of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> writers composed a gospel in Hebrew script.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">St.&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome" title="Jerome">Jerome</a> is most helpful in understanding the origins of this Gospel. According to Jerome, the<strong>Gospel of the Hebrews</strong> was written in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac" title="Syriac">Syriac</a> language (Aramaic) and used Hebrew letters. Most people of Jerome&rsquo;s day called it "The Authentic Gospel of Matthew", as they believed the Apostle of Jesus who was the tax collector composed it. The Aramaic original was preserved at the library in Caesarea, but copies existed in the&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazarene" title="Nazarene">Nazarene</a></em> community in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo" title="Aleppo">Beroea</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syria</a>, as well as in the&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebionite" title="Ebionite">Ebionite</a></em> community.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Jerome believed this gospel was authoritative and wrote about it extensively, thus preserving much of the text.</span></p>

Rather, Matthias who replaced Judas is supposedly the same as Levi. Thus, Matthew is Matthew, and Matthias who replaces Judas in Acts 1 as one of the twelve is also known as Levi:</span></div>

<div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">I do not necessarily agree this is the case. I am simply mentioning one topic for which the Gospel of the Hebrews supposedly mentions which addresses this issue.</span></div>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Chapter One Problems of Matthew</strong></span></h2>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Chapter One of Matthew in the Hebrew or Ebionite Matthew is supposedly missing chapter one. (This is based upon an exaggerated interpretation of Epiphanius.) If true, this would solve two issues with Matthew. The Greek traditional text has two errors in chapter one: the geneology is erroneous and it mistranslates Isaiah (which speaks of a "maiden" - not a virgin) and renders it as a "virgin," which then fits the virgin birth account in the same chapter.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">This supports believing that the Ebionite Matthew is more accurate for having either no chapter one (a misread of Epiphanius) or truncated version missing the virgin birth account (which is the true case). In the 300s, it was faulted for having no virgin birth account per Epiphanius (who elsewhere admitted it had some geneology from Abraham but did not recount a virgin birth). Here is Epiphanius's objection to the omission of the birth of Christ by the Hebrew version of Matthew, and the omission of a genealogy which some (including myself) once thought Epiphanius meant there was no genealogy. But elsewhere Epiphanius says the Ebionite genealogy starts with Abraham. He must have meant in this next quote that he heard there was no genealogy but later he found out there is one, but it does not have a virgin birth account:</span><br />
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><em>Epiphanius</em></span><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Their Gospel commences as follows: &ldquo;In the days of King Herod of Judea, a certain man named John came baptizing with a baptism of repentance in the river Jordan. He was said to be of the family of Aaron the priest, son of Zechariah and Elizabeth, and all went out to him.&rdquo; There is no genealogy in their Gospel of Matthew, which commences as already stated: &ldquo;In the days of King Herod of Judea, during the high-priesthood of Caiaphas.&rdquo; Their gospel says, &ldquo;This man named John came baptizing with a baptism of repentance in the Jordan River, et cetera.&rdquo; (Epiphanius, Panarion 30.13.6) [Quoted in<em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentic_Gospel_of_Matthew">Wikipedia</a></em>.]</span></blockquote>

<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><em>Epiphanius</em></span><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">In the&nbsp;<strong>Gospel called &lsquo;of Matthew&rsquo;</strong> which they call the&nbsp;<strong>Hebrew Gospel</strong> is written the following: &ldquo;There was a certain man named Jesus, about thirty years old, who chose us. Coming to Capernaum, He entered the house of Simon, who is called Peter, and said, &lsquo;As I passed by the Sea of Galilee, I chose John and James, sons of Zebedee, and Simon, and Andrew, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, Judas Iscariot; and you Matthew, sitting at the tax office, I called and you followed me. You therefore, I want to be the Twelve, to symbolize Israel.&rsquo;&rdquo; And &ldquo;It so happened that John came baptizing, and Pharisees and all Jerusalem came out to him to get baptized. And John wore clothing made of camel hair and had a leather belt about his waist. His food,&rdquo; it continues, &ldquo;consisted of wild honey that tasted like manna, like sweet cake cooked in oil.&rdquo; (Epiphanius, Panarion 30.13.2)</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The Ebionite difficulty with Matthew 1 in the Greek, which mistranslates "maiden" or "young girl," as "virgin," is evident at this snipe of them by Irenaeus:</span><br />
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">God, then, was made man, and the Lord did Himself save us, giving us the token of the Virgin. But not as some allege, among those now presuming to expound the Scripture, [thus:] "Behold, a young woman shall conceive, and bring forth a son," as Theodotion the Ephesian has interpreted, and Aquila of Pontus, both Jewish proselytes. The Ebionites, following these, assert that He was begotten by Joseph; thus destroying, as far as in them lies, such a marvelous dispensation of God, and setting aside the testimony of the prophets which proceeded from God.<em>(Irenaeus, Adversus haereses (Against Heresies), 180 A.D.)</em></span></blockquote>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Perhaps the Ebionites pointed out the error in rendering "virgin" for a Hebrew word meaning "maiden." Critics of the Ebionites then inadvertently confused them with Symmachus who was Jewish, and who attacked the Christian Greek canon by showing "virgin" was a mistranslation of the Isaiah passage in Matthew 1. The ancient critics thus lumped Symmachus with the Ebionites. But the Ebionites did not have a virgin birth story at all, and thus lumping them with Symmachus was unfounded. Instead, Symmachus was attacking the Greek traditional text of Matthew as the accepted standard as a means of attacking Christianity while the Ebionites were Christians who were Jewish in background, and whose version of Matthew never had a virgin birth account anyway. &nbsp;Here is the misguided critique by Eusebius that erroneously claimed Symmachus was an Ebionite:</span><br />
<blockquote><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">[The Translator Symmachus] "As to these translators it should be stated that Symmachus was an Ebionite. But the heresy of the Ebionites, as it is called, asserts that Christ was the son of Joseph and Mary, considering him a mere man, and insists strongly on keeping the law in a Jewish manner, as we have seen already in this history. Commentaries of Symmachus are still extant in which he appears to support this heresy by attacking the Gospel of Matthew. Origen states that he obtained these and other commentaries of Symmachus on the Scriptures from a certain Juliana, who, he says, received the books by inheritance from Symmachus himself."<em>(Eusebius, 4th century, Ecclesiastical History</em>)&nbsp;</span></blockquote>

For his countrymen keep the same rule of monarchy and polity everywhere, being unable in any way to think otherwise, or to be led out of the way of the much-indicating Scriptures. For, according to the rule delivered to them, they endeavor to correct the discordances of the Scriptures, if any one, haply not knowing the traditions, is confounded at the various utterances of the prophets. Wherefore they charge no one to teach, unless he has first learned how the Scriptures must be used. And thus they have amongst them one God, one law, one hope."</span></div>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Theories to Reconstruct the Original</strong></span></h2>
<div><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Let's assume the Canonical Greek Matthew comes last. But let's assume there was a Hebrew Matthew original whose Greek translation mentioned in the 2d century forms the basis of the Canonical Greek Matthew. How then can we discover that original Matthew by textual analysis? In reliance on Reville's excellent work cited above, the anonymous&nbsp;<em>The Oldest Gospel</em> says we potentially would subtract everything in common with Mark as a borrowing by the Canonical Greek Matthew from Mark. But everything unique to Canonical Matthew would be the original Hebrew Matthew predating Mark.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">For example, the Sermon on the Mount is not in Mark. Thus, this passage of the canonical Matthew is from the Hebrew Matthew. Passages in common were borrowed from Mark to bring the canonical Matthew more in line with Mark.&nbsp;<em>See&nbsp;The Oldest Gospel</em> (London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1870) at&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SLwCAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=the%20oldest%20gospel&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">iv</a>. The author explains:&nbsp;</span></div>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">If the first canonical gospel, as we possess it, is founded on " discourses of Jesus" written by Matthew, is it possible to separate the component parts ? Can we, by a process of analysis, obtain the original work of Matthew? In answer to these questions, it has been already pointed out that there is in the first gospel a series of discourses, which have nothing corresponding to them in the second gospel; and that when we take away these discourses from the first, what is left corresponds nearly entirely with the second, while portions of the discourses are found scattered through the third, gospel. Now the passages thus peculiar to the first gospel have, as I have said, a character of their own; they contain&mdash;the phrase "kingdom of<span data-mce-mark="1"> heaven," 32 times, while it is never found in the second gospel;&mdash;the phrase "Father in heaven," 22 times, while it occurs only once in the second gospel. Besides these and other verbal peculiarities, they have a special reference throughout to the establishment of a coming reign of the Messiah, and are marked by a prevailing Judaism of tone. On these grounds Dr. Seville indicates certain portions of the first gospel, as being translations of the Hebrew "discourses of Jesus," which was the work of Matthew. I have for the most part adopted his conclusions, omitting only a few verses as to which there seemed some doubt, because I desire to include no sections which may not with tolerable certainty be attributed to Matthew.&nbsp;<em>Id.</em>, at<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SLwCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"> iv</a> - v.</span></span></div>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">All that survives to us from the 'Gospel of the Hebrews' are several quotations made by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ntcanon.org/Clement.shtml#Gospel_of_the_Hebrews">Clement</a>,<a href="http://www.ntcanon.org/Origen.shtml#Gospel_of_the_Hebrews">Origen</a>, Jerome, and Cyril of Jerusalem. Jerome took a lively interest in this book, an Aramaic copy of which he found in the famous library at Caesarea in Palestine. More than once he tells us (and with great pride) that he made translations of it into Greek and Latin. Unfortunately, these translations have been lost. According to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ntcanon.org/Stichometry_of_Nicephorus.shtml">Stichometry of Nicephorus</a>, it comprised 2200 lines, which is only 300 fewer than the length of the&nbsp;<em>Gospel according to Matthew</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The time and place of origin are disputed, but since Clement used it in the last quarter of the 2nd century, it is usually dated to about the middle of that century. Egypt is indicated as its place of origin by the fact that its principal witnesses are the Alexandrians Clement and Origen, by the religio-historical character of two of the fragments, and by the conception of Jesus as the Son of the Holy Spirit, which is documented for Egypt by the Coptic Epistle of James. The original language of the gospel suggests that it was drawn up for Hebrew and Aramaic-speaking Jewish Christians in Palestine and Syria.</span></p>

Quoted by Paul, Acts 20:35. Comp. Luke 6:30, 31; also Clement of Rome, Ad Cor. c.2, edion didontes e lambanontes, "more gladly giving than receiving."

" An addition to Luke 6:4, in Codex D. or Bezae (in the University library at Cambridge), which contains several remarkable additions. See Tischendorf's apparatus in ed. VIII. Luc.6:4, and Scrivener, lntrod. to Criticism of the N.

T.); parabates tou nomouby Paul (Rom.2:25, 27; Gal.2:18) and James (2:9, 11). Plumptre regards the narrative as authentic, and remarks that "it brings out with a marvellous force the distinction between the conscious transgression of a law recognized as still binding, and the assertion of a higher law as superseding the lower. Comp. also the remarks of Hofmann, l.c. p.318.</span></span></p>

An addition in Codex D. to Matt 20:28. See Tischendorf. Comp. Luke 14:11; John 5:44. Westcott regards this as a genuine fragment. Nicholson inserts "not," with the Curetonian Syriac, D; all other authorities omit it. Juvencus has incorporated the passage in his poetic Hist. Evang. III.613 sqq., quoted by Hofmann, p.319.</span></span></p>

Quoted by Clement of Alexandria (several times), Origen (in Joann, xix.), Eusebius, Epiphanius, Cyril of Alexandria, and many others. Comp.1 Thess.5:21: "Prove all things, hold fast the good," and the parable of the talents, Matt.25:27. Delitzsch, who with many others regards this maxim as genuine, gives it the meaning: Exchange the less valuable for the more valuable, esteem sacred coin higher than common coin, and highest of all the one precious pearl of the gospel.(Ein Tag in Capernaum, p.136.) Renan likewise adopts it as historical, but explains it in an Ebionite and monastic sense as an advice of voluntary poverty. "Be ye good bankers (soyez de bons banquiers), that is to say: Make good investments for the kingdom of God, by giving your goods to the poor, according to the ancient proverb (Prov.19:17): 'He that hath pity upon the poor, lendeth to the Lord' " (Vie de J&eacute;sus, ch.

'Let us resist all iniquity, and hold it in abhorrence.' " From the Epistle of Barnabas, c.4. This Epistle, though incorporated in the Codex Sinaiticus, is probably not a work of the apostolic Barnabas. Westcott and Plumptre quote the passage from the Latin version, which introduces the sentence with the words: sicut dicit Filius Dei. But this seems to be a mistake for sicut decet filios Dei, "as becometh the sons of God." This is evident from the Greek original (brought to light by the discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus), which reads, hos prepei huiois theou and connects the words with the preceding sentence. See the edition of Barnabae Epistula by Gebhardt and Harnack in Patr. Apost. Op. I.14.

From the Epistle of Barnabas, c.7, where the words are introduced by "Thus he [Jesus] saith," phesin But it is doubtful whether they are meant as a quotation or rather as a conclusion of the former remarks and a general reminiscence of several passages. Comp. Matt.16:24; 20:3; Acts 14:22: "We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."</span></p>

From the "Gospel of the Hebrews," quoted by Clement of Alexandria (Strom. II.9, &sect; 45). The Alexandrian divine quotes this and the following sentence to show, as Plumptre finely says, "that in the teaching of Christ, as in that of Plato, wonder is at once the beginning and the end of knowledge."</span></p>

Quoted by Clement of Alexandria (Strom. I.24, &sect; 154; comp. IV.6, &sect; 34) and Origen (de Oratione, c.2), with slight differences. Comp. Matt.6:33, of which it is probably a free quotation from memory. Ambrose also quotes the sentence (Ep. xxxvi.3): "Denique scriptum est: 'Petite magna, et parva adjicientur vobis. Petite coelestia, et terrena adjicientur.'"</span></p>

Quoted by Justin Martyr (Dial. c. Tryph. c.47), and Clement of Alexandria (Quis dives, &sect; 40). Somewhat different Nilus: "Such as I find thee, I will judge thee, saith the Lord." The parallel passages in Ezekiel 7:3, 8; 18:30; 24:14; 33:20 are not sufficient to account for this sentence. It is probably taken from an apocryphal Gospel. See Hofmann, p.323.</span></p>

For I say unto you, he that is faithful in the least is faithful also in much." From the homily of Pseudo-Clement of Rome (ch.8). Comp. Luke 16:10-12 and Matt.25:21, 23. Irenaeus (II.34, 3) quotes similarly, probably from memory: "Si in modico fideles non fuistis, quod magnum est quis dabit nobis?"</span></p>

From Pseudo-Clement, ch.8. But as this is connected with the former sentence by ara oun touto legei, it seems to be only an explanation ("he means this") not a separate quotation. See Lightfoot, St. Clement of Rome, pp.200 and 201, and his Appendix containing the newly recovered Portions, p.384:. On the sense comp.2 Tim.2:19; Rom.4:11; Eph.1:13; 4:30.</span></p>

From Clement of Alexandria, as a quotation from "the Gospel according to the Egyptians" (Strom.III.13, &sect; 92), and the homily of Pseudo-Clement of Rome (ch.12). Comp. Matt.22:30; Gal.3:28; 1 Cor.7:29. The sentence has a mystical coloring which is alien to the genuine Gospels, but suited the Gnostic taste.</span></p>

And that all animals, using for food what is received from the earth, shall live in peace and concord with one another, subject to men with all subjection.' " To this description Papias adds: "These things are credible to those who believe. And when Judas the traitor believed not and asked, 'How shall such products come from the Lord?' the Lord said, 'They shall see who come to me in these times.' " From the "weak-minded" Papias (quoted by Irenaeus, Adv. Haer. V.33, 3). Comp. Isa.11:6-9.</span></p>

Westcott thinks it is based on a real discourse, but to me it sounds fabulous, and borrowed from the Apocalypse of Baruch which has a similar passage (cap.29, first published in Monumenta Sacra et Profana opera collegii Doctorum Bibliothecae Ambrosianae, Tom. I. Fasc. II. Mediol.1866, p.80, and then in Fritzsche's ed. of Libri Apocryphi Veteris Test. Lips.1871, p.666): "Etiam terra dabit fructus suos unum in decem millia, et in vite una erunt Mille palmites, et unus palmes faciet mille botros, et botrus unus faciet mille acinos, et unus acinus faciet corum vini. Et qui esurierunt jucundabuntur, iterum autem videbunt prodigia quotidie .... Et erit in illo tempore, descendet iterum desuper thesaurus manna, et comedent ex eo in istis annis."</span></span></p>

Nicholson has gathered the probable or possible fragments of the Gospel according to the Hebrews, which correspond more or less to passages in the canonical Gospels.</span></p>

They are color coded for easy identification. This volume is the same as volume 3, except volume 3 strips out all citations and selects the best variants (still color coded) in the view of the editor to create what is hoped to be recognized as the restored Original Gospel of Matthew.

It discusses the importance of restoring Yahweh's name where it was originally. Also the Appendix covers the topic of the validity of the Virgin Birth Account, as well as whether the Ebionites -- the custodians of the earliest Matthew -- were indeed orthodox.
