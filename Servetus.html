<big><big><big>1. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Founding of USA and Its Constitution</span><br>


<small><small>Calvin revealed himself at Geneva, especially in the
Servetus Affair, as less than an advocate of free speech and the
freedom of religion. Yet, modern Calvinists claim our revolution was a
Calvinist Revolution. Calvinists also claim the Christians who
led&nbsp;our Revolution were Calvinists. Are these claims true? <span style="font-style: italic;">No.<br>

first demands for freedom of religion in America were made in the 1657
Remonstrances by English citizens within the Dutch Republic. Even
though article 13 of the Dutch Constitution protected the freedom of
religion, the Calvinists had usurped that, and had
persecuted&nbsp;those who resisted the Dutch Reformed Church in the
Netherlands, and now extended this to&nbsp;Boston and New Amsterdaam
(N.Y.)'s&nbsp;Dutch colonies. Thus, the 1657 Remonstrances was the
first seed of religious liberty planted in America, and it was
specifically planted <span style="font-style: italic;">against</span>
Calvinist encroachment on guaranteed civil liberities in the Dutch
Constitution of 1579. Thus, to say our revolution was Calvinist is
absurd. We copied almost all of the Dutch Republic's institutions, but
they were all formed prior to the usurpation of Calvinism in the
Netherlands to take control. Thus, the history of the rise and fall of
the Dutch Republic is more&nbsp;testimony of the evil&nbsp;fruits
of Calvinism.<br>

</span><big><big>2. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Servetus Affair Teaches The&nbsp;Intent of the First Amendment</span></big></big><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>


<br>


</span></span>Jefferson mentioned four times the Servetus Affair in his
writings. In the First Amendment,
Jefferson&nbsp;unquestionably&nbsp;desired to separate church from
state in the sense violated at Geneva in 1553. One can &nbsp;only
understand Jefferson's rationale for the First Amendment, and his
words about separation, when one reads Jefferson's attacks on Calvin's
behavior in&nbsp;the Servetus Affair. Separation did not mean to remove
religious expression or support in state institutions,
emblems,&nbsp;legislation or properties, but to remove the state as the
&nbsp;arbiter of correct opinion on religious issues. This is what
Jefferson's letter on seperation means, both expressly and by means of
an oblique reference to the Servetus Affair.<br>

5. <big>Calvin's Subversion of Geneva in 1555 and Responsibility For Later&nbsp;Killing of Heretics<br>
</big></small></small></span><small><small><big><small><small>Calvin
set the precedent of killing heretics in Geneva in 1553. This was then
used in 1555 to kill political opponents, and gain hegemony over
Geneva. This tactic was repeated again in 1581 to subvert the young
Dutch Republic which guaranteed religious liberty in its Constitution.
Calvinists usurped the laws of the Netherlands, and then created a de facto state church out of the
Dutch Reformed Church. They then persecuted and killed Christians who
dissented from their views. They did this in the Council of Dort in
1619, and then again with the Boston Martyrs in 1659-1661. This tendency to
kill anyone who was suspected of being different also led to
the&nbsp;Salem Witch Trials, again perpetrated by Calvinist Puritans
trying to imitate the Geneva Republic. For a detailed 27 page analysis,

<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">6.</span><big><big> </big></big>Calvin's Moral Responsibility for&nbsp;Catholic Slaughter of Calvinists</big></big><br>
Calvin bears moral responsibility for the Catholic decision to kill
Calvinists in the Netherlands and in France between 1568 and 1572 while
leaving the Lutherans alone. This is because Lutherans did not believe
in persecuting heretics, while Calvin, due to the Servetus Affair,
endorsed killing heretics in 1554 as a means of deflecting the charge
of murder over killing Servetus. Calvin's failure to admit his failing
led to this poor excuse, and the consequent message to Catholics that
they were in danger if the French Huguenots or the Calvinists of the
Netherlands rose in influence because then they would kill Catholics as
heretics. The Catholics then predictably made a pre-emptive strike on
the Calvinists of France in 1572 (at least 25,000 were killed) and the
Netherlands in 1568 (20,000 were killed). For a detailed 22 page
analysis see the next linked document/webpage.<br>

7.</span></big></big> <big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord Acton's Example</span></big></big><br>
Lord Acton was a Catholic who 300 years after the St. Batholomew's
Massacre felt compelled to expose the Pope and his cardinals'
responsibility for the murder of 25,000 to 100,000 French Huguenots.
Lord Acton believed that because the Catholic Church claimed it was
upolding true doctrine, it was important to remember it committed mass
murder. It needed to repent. Lord Acton is an excellent example that
Calvinists should imitate with respect to Calvin's role in killing
Servetus. No matter how much time has gone by, it is imperative that
those who claim to be the heirs of someone who turns out to be a
murderer need to confess the crime, and seek repentance from all those
following the criminal's doctrines and who honor his memory. For
extensive analysis on Lord' Acton's exposure, see the linked
document/webpage<br>
