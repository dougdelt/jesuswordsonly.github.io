He comes on after a brief introduction.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Incidentally, Gordon elsewhere contends the Holy Name is pronounced Yehovah, not Yahweh. However, I respectfully believe this is incorrect. See detailed critique of Gordon's arguments at <a href="http://scripturaltruth101.blogspot.com/2013/02/nehemia-gordon-and-name-of-yehovah.html">Scriptural Truth Blogspot</a>. Essentially, Gordon would be correct if YHVH was a "conjunction word" or "composite word" (which Gordon calls "compound word"), but it is not. YHVH is a single word. As a compound word, the implied vowels would allide (blend) from an A sound to a EH sound. In a non-compound word, such as YHVH, the YH keeps its same full pronunciation as when it appears at the end of a compound word. So ALLELUYAH -- a compound word -- proves YH at end would at the start of a non-compound word be similarly pronounced YAH. &nbsp;Hence, in YHVH, the first part is clearly pronounced YAH, not YEH. Then if Gordon were correct, and one treats the last letter H as a suffix to a compound word, then the accent (under Hebrew grammar) is upon that last syllable. In that case, the end would be pronounced UVAH, not OVAH. But YHVH is not a composed / compound word, and thus it is neither UVAH nor OVAH at the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">My own review makes me confident that the single non-composite word is pronounced Yahweh. This is also the view of the Jewish Encyclopedia, so who is better to know the truth than the Jewish Encylopedia? See <a href="/home/4-recommendedreading/134-yahweh.html">link.</a></span></p>

Platt shows the context of the quote Paul lifted to teach "call on the name of the Lord" and "be saved" -- read by most to prove salvation is by a sinner's prayer -- was taken from the book of Joel 2:28-32, but in context it meant a repenting people who were fasting. See <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joel+1%3A13-14&amp;version=NIV">Joel 1:13-14</a> (a call to lamentation / repentance). Platt closes with a sermon call to conversion by repentance from sin. He is using a correct first step, and this would be good for deluded Christian people who have never heard a non-Pauline Gospel. I would add Peter quotes Joel 2:28-32 the same way as does Platt -- in a plea for repentance from sin and turning to the Father, and His annointed One, Jesus, in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2">Acts 2:14-41</a>. Hence, Platt is trying to correct the application of Paul's teaching in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+10&amp;version=NIV">Romans 10:13</a>. Platt does not acknowledge Paul may be responsibile for wrongfully ignoring the context of Joel, or whether Paul does in fact teach faith alone. For in Romans 10, Paul criticizes Jews who "sought to establish their own righteousness" -- which is not an error but taught in Deut. 6:25 (our obedience is deemed justification). Platt deals with Paul's words in Romans 10 first at minute 28. He says Paul teaches we are to trust in Christ, but then does not try to tell us Paul teaches faith-alone in Romans 10. So we are at a loss to know why Platt can ignore Paul, and not try to explain away Romans 10 in some fashion. In fact, in Romans 10, Paul quotes the Septuagint of Isaiah 28:16 that is rendered by Paul as whoever "believes in him will not be put to shame." But this is a Septuagint mistranslation upon which Paul relies. The verse says in the original Hebrew: "<span data-mce-mark="1">So this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who <em><strong>relies on it</strong></em> will never be stricken with <em><strong>panic</strong></em>." (Isaiah 28:16, NIV) So to "rely upon" Jesus, in the true translation, implies to follow and obey. Thus, the change of Isaiah 28:16 by Paul to "believe in" means just that -- faith alone, and "you will be saved." Hence, Platt is leaving open the question of why is he ignoring Paul's meaning. I would say Paul is uninspired, and that is why we must follow Jesus' warnings, and Peter's better example in Acts 2:14-41. On more about the mistranslation in the Septuagint text in Isaiah 28:16, and Paul's misquote even of that Septuagint mistranslation to force faith-alone into the prophet's mouth, see our article&nbsp;<a href="/home/1-jwo/568-isaiah-2816-another-septuagint-mistranslation.html">Isaiah 28:16, Another Septuagint Mistranslation.</a></span></span></p>

Then Jesus ties this to Torah when Jesus concludes those who are false prophets are identified by disobedience to Torah, and not whether they did signs and wonders of miracles, prophecies and exorcisms. This video author does not explain what proof Jesus in Greek is saying "disobedience to Torah" - in English "work lawlessness,"&nbsp; but the author is correct the word here means "break Torah."

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The Brethren Church in the USA traces back to the non-Pauline Brethren of Europe. It has a great emphasis on Jesus, and following Jesus. See their <a href="http://www.brethren.org/about/beliefs.html">Beliefs</a> from brethren.org.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">The very first sermon I listened to -- October 20, 2013 -- was great. It was about Luke's account of the people pressing Jesus at the lake's edge, Jesus getting in the boat, asking Peter to take the boat further out, and there is a big catch. The sermon sees insights into this passage that are not visible on the surface, and thus is very motivating spiritually. So please listen-watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0rE8scUIRM">Ben Barlow's sermon for the Brethren Spring 2013 Conference</a> from You Tube.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">A young man named Steven passionately and intelligently put up during two lunch breaks at work two great short videos while his friend records. He very effectively uses an easel. His theme is to choose Jesus over Paul. It is to live outside your comfort zone of attending a 'church,' of enjoying a position at church, etc. The young man was amazing. It is in two parts -- here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQu2JUDACyM&amp;feature=youtu.be">part one</a>, and here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiLmxvLOHq0&amp;feature=youtu.be">part two</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">Rich in Spirit - False Apostle Paul, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8xrXcF0yd8&amp;feature=youtu.be">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jmuZAJMKBs&amp;feature=youtu.be">Part 2</a>&nbsp;(2015) I like much of what she says, but I disagree with her rejection of Jesus' death as a sacrifice for our sins (as is clear to me in Isaiah 53 and Jesus' words at the Last Supper). See video # 1 at 2:30-57. On the other hand, I do find her astute about Constantine potentially altering the NT, and censoring dissent, to establish his doctrines. See video #1 at 4:30 et seq. I have not listened to any of her other videos. I see she thinks there are specific prophecies about her race "The Future of the Negros." &nbsp;I hope it is sensible, but I have not had time to listen to her other works yet. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCHOKhYxUCP6Zlyv0YvX0A">Ive Ministerio</a>. An excellent video series in 8 parts entitled the False Apostle Paul. Each is 4 hours + long. Before listening, one might be skeptical that one could sustain over 30 hours of critical analysis on Paul's validity. But he does a very thorough and excellent exposition on many passages. I particularly liked his exposition on Romans 7 and 10 in part 2. Here are the 5 parts: Paul the Liar and False Apostle - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3n49nhyg1Q">part 1</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJU8Ash6iDo">part 2</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXq3C06lrZ8">part 3</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtKZnGMLa3g">part 4</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhAOaWaHOg">part 5</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMH3SPufaNo">part 6</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zca-q1RNQKU">part 7</a>; and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiGiIH6-64">part 8</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">At Part 1, 52 minutes, the video speaker does a great exposition on Matthew 7:15-23. He explains that many will come in Jesus' name includes false apostles, even though they preach in "my name" and cast out demons in Jesus' name, and did many wonderful works, like epistles, etc., but Jesus will say "I never knew you." It is not they knew Jesus and fell away; Jesus is going to say he 'never' knew them. The worker of "iniquity" more literally means one who break the Law of God.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 18pt;">Interesting new points not found elsewhere include that at 49:55 of part 1, he points out that if Jesus intended the disciples to know he would send another Apostle to preach primarily to the Gentiles, Jesus would have prophesied of that truth. Instead, as he later points out, Matthew 5:17-19 is a negative prophecy of the least or small one -- the meaning of the name Paul -- that instead was subtly placed as a warning prophecy about Paul. </span></p>

They will try to deflect the view that Paul said the Law was abrogated. The video author claims Paul taught grace so we would not sin against the Law but to receive forgiveness. That would be nice, if true. But the speaker does not deal with Paul's anti-law verses. He is arguably correct that Paul never "blatantly said to break the <strong>Highest</strong>&nbsp;Laws." That is if you assume this video commentator means what Jesus called the greatest command in Mark 5 - "the Lord our God is one" from Deut 6:4. But Paul negates both big and small laws, e.g., Paul loosens the law against eating meat sacrificed to idols (<a href="/home/1-jwo/554-idol-meat-issue-paul-versus-jesus.html">link</a>); Paul loosens the right of widows, regardless of age, to charity (<a href="/home/1-jwo/99-paul-women-and-sex.html">link</a>#1;<a href="/home/1-jwo/578-evil-immoral-commands-from-paul.html"> link</a> #2); Paul says one should not seek marriage as this distracts one from God, negating Genesis 2:8 that marriage is good for companionship (<a href="/home/1-jwo/589-paul-knocks-marriage-in-1-corinthians-7.html">link</a>); etc. </span></p>

Paul does not repeat it. </span></p>

He cites Acts 9:27 where Paul debated the Greeks. The video commentator says this implies Paul only criticizes Pagan beliefs. But that does not logically follow. Regardless, I like his intention to say that we must set aside the notion &nbsp;that the Law is void, whether because Paul supposedly does not abrogate the law, or for reasons I give on this website. Hence, a good result follows from his approach, even though I don't think it has a good foundation that Paul was pro-Law.&nbsp;</span></p>

I have no hesitation that its fruit is evil. ...It has divided Christians, and wrecked assemblies. It has lifted up its votaries to an appalling extent, ... sown discord on missionary fields abroad. ...It is an absolutely Satanic perversion of the truth." &nbsp;Ironside is addressing Bullinger who was the first modern proponent of this notion -- even though it was Marcion in 140 AD who first said the same thing. Bullinger taught that Paul was the first to be truly saved in the new dispensation on the Road to Damascus. The YouTube at 29:42 says Bullingerism teaches the 12 apostles taught another gospel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Steve Schlisell, Senior Pastor, Covenant Community Church in Brooklyn advances law v. faith correctly, as well as salvation. For this, Paulinists excoriate him because he ignores Paul. This is the clue he is on the right track. Here is a Paulinist page with many Schlisell quotes. If you ignore the erroneous critique, you will see a good message. So enjoy "<a href="http://theonomyresources.blogspot.com/2010/09/beware-of-steve-schlissel.html">Beware Steve Schlisell</a>."See also Schlissel's own argument on <a href="http://www.messiahnyc.org/ArticlesDetail.asp?id=103">Law and Faith</a>.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">His church's website is at this</span><a href="http://www.messiahnyc.org/staff.asp" style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.3em;"> link</a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">. Unfortunately, Schlissel still believes in Paul and defends God lies in reliance upon Paul, citing 1 Thessalonians where Paul says God will send a "delusion." (See </span><a href="http://www.messiahnyc.org/media/img/media6-22.mov" style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.3em;">video</a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">.) Schlissel &nbsp;also relies upon Calvin's favorite passage from 1 Kings where Micaiah, a prophet, said God sent a lie, but I believe this only proved Micaiah was a false prophet. It does not truly prove God lies. Hence, you must be on guard about Schlissel because he still believes Paul is a valid teacher that God lies, as the Reformed churches have long believed.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">John MacArthur (generally) - <a href="http://www.kkla.com/ministryaudio/grace-to-you/">grace to you broadcasts in MP3</a> Grace to you - <a href="http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/grace-to-you/listen/responding-to-gods-word-252508.html">Archives</a>. I do not, of course, agree with much of what MacArthur teaches. Yet, there is still value in much of what he teaches -- more so than strict Paulinists. MacArthur teaches a version of 'faith alone' that requires submission to Jesus and obedience to Him. And thus it is not a true 'faith alone' position, but 'faith plus' in keeping with Bonhoeffer, Kierkegaard and other modern critics of the salvation doctrine of the modern church.</span></p>

He says instead salvation is by faith alone, <strong><em>preceded and followed by repentance.</em> </strong>(Such a salvation formula only starts and ends with repentance and thus is not truly a faith alone doctrine.) He is doing an exposition on Matt 7 where Jesus talks about the narrow gate, and that many will claim they did miracles and signs in his name, but Jesus will say "I never knew you." Other than his forced conformity to 'faith alone,' like MacArthur before him, the message is based upon Jesus' clear words.</span></p>

A young lady has done an excellent exposition in two videos on the flaws in common arguments in favor of Trinitarianism. The Trinity teaches God is composed of three individuals of separate minds and wills, and each has a right to be worshipped as God apart from the other, yet each are part of a unity and hence God is still ONE.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">Sounds logical and appropriate through 85%. Says something is not right in pulpit. Many teach Jesus' words are for Jews only and Paul is for everyone else. One proof Paul was prophesied by Jesus is when Jesus said "beware yeast of the Pharisees." Paul was a Pharisee. A hint who one of the false prophets is going to be. Jesus also said "beware the sheep in wolf's clothing." Look into different tribes of Israel. Look at each tribe what is their insignia -- some use a deer, ox, etc. But the tribe of Benjamin uses as its emblem a wolf. Paul tells us he comes from the tribe of Benjamin. These are aspects of Paul -- Benjamite and Pharisee -- that we should focus upon. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">At 12:57, he quotes the<em><strong> non-canonical book</strong></em> (which I never have heard of) entitled <em>Last Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs</em>. He says there is a prophecy from Benjamin himself called "Testament of Benjamin" within that book. He is quoting from modern book entitled "Lost Books of the Bible." At Ch. 2 verse 18, speaking of Savior and end-times, it discusses God will come in the flesh of a man, and Benjamin will say at one point he will no longer be called a "ravening wolf." This author misses the better quote which is Genesis 49:27. Then he discusses Jesus mentions the ravening wolf in sheep's clothing. He defends that alot of scripture exists outside the Bible which I find highly dubious. But then he goes in the correct direction that Paul contradicts the teachings of Jesus. Hence, it is ok for much of it, but alot of it treats as authoritative non-Scriptural sources without proof of their validity.</span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;" data-mce-mark="1">He points out that Church was paganized at time the canon process was being completed. The pagan highest day became Christ's birthday; Sabbath was banned, etc. Let's look at fruit of Paul and see if contradicts self or lies. In Philemon, Paul says "I am not going to mention you owe me your very soul." But Trustin says this is false that another owes you their soul if you led them to Christ. We only owe our soul to Jesus, but not to Paul. (Bravo!) Second, Paul says when around Jews he will follow the Jews, and when he is around pagans, he will act no longer as a Jew but accomodate the pagans. When Peter supposedly does a similar thing, Paul calls Peter a hypocrite. This video is essentially ok. I just think it loosely makes claim that the church was entirely paganized at the time the canon process completed. I would say canon was never even decided in that period. It was only until Council of Trent it was agreed upon -- and that was in the 1500s!</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">This author begins well -- saying it is not faith alone that saves. If you don't follow up by obedience, it is as if dead, as James said. The good news - Gospel -- Yahshua -- he claims God in the flesh to remarry his bride had to die to fulfill that part of the Law. Thus, he believes God had to die to fullfill the Law, and this is how he could remarry Israel whom he 'divorced.' (I think this accepts Paul's flawed Christology in Romans 7:1-7, and is blasphemy. God is immortal. See our article <a href="/home/4-recommendedreading/104-flawedchristologyofpaul.html">Paul's Flawed Christology</a>.) But this death of God (uggh!) supposedly does not change God's doctrine. Then Unstitched says Jesus came for the lost sheep of Israel, his bride, and not Gentiles. (Then why did Jesus's final words before His ascension tell the apostles to "teach the nations everything that I commanded"?) Unstitched says Christianity offers adoptionism where everyone can be adopted, and this author says no one else can enter into the faith but Jews. (I think this goes too far, and if true, Jesus should have said so. Portions of the Mosaic covenant were obligatory on sojourners / Gentiles who lived in community with Jews, so if only Jews can be saved, then why did the Law's benefits extend to sojourners who voluntarily sought atonement?)</span></li>

Would God have to free us from Laws that give freedom? Mainstream doctrine teaches us that we are freed by getting rid of the Law, making the freedom offered by Jesus different from that freedom offered by the Father. The Law is "perfect" and then how can it be later more "perfect." They cite and quote Paul as the word of God. This video helps prove to those who know the Bible's definition of apostasy that Paul's teachings directly lead to such an outcome. This video embraces what the Bible identifies as apostasy (which results in a lost condition) as proper and right. Uggh!</span></p>

Part I.</a> This video begins by portraying that the only people who thinks Paul is not a true apostle are either atheists, Muslims, or people in the occult. &nbsp;This relies upon judging an issue by attacking the person speaking. This is known as the Ad Hominem Fallacy. &nbsp;At 28:23 mark of the video, he now tells you that Jesus did teach the Law, but &nbsp;Paul correctly tells us not to follow the Law because what Jesus offered was rejected by Jews. This is why Jesus chose Paul to go to Plan B. The author does not tell you, but this is known as Dispensationalism -- of the hyper variety. Jesus' teachings are supposedly completely irrelevant, and only Paul's teachings -- which never quote Jesus in any epistle to support a doctrine. This video speaker claims that the Law will become important again in the future in the milennium kingdom. I would comment that all dispensational doctrines are false. They contradict multiple of Jesus' statements, such as telling the apostles just prior to his Ascension to teach the nations "all that I commanded you." But this video author think we are supposed to believe Jesus taught Paul not to do so, and instead told Paul what Paul alone taught. Also, Jesus said the Law would not pass away until the heavens and earth pass away. But I would comment that Paul teaches, and dispensationalism agrees, that the Law has faded / passed away, which was supposedly signaled by the glory-light fading away from Moses' face after speaking with Yahweh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Brad Scott, Messianic. False Apostle or Falsely Accused, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJuiBHGNWQ4">part 1</a>. In first 27 minutes, he claims Paul may appear contradictory of Christ, but he contends that is by means of argument where we do not track carefully somehow, but instead we can "solve the situation," if we try hard enough, to find no contradiction. I too agree we should find plausible explanations that do not present contradictions between Jesus and Paul, but after a while, a valid set of 25 contradictions are unavoidable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">The first point is he addresses 1 Cor. 11:1-2 at the 27:26 mark. This verse begins "be ye followers of me even as I am a follower of Messiah." Then Brad says he would have no leg to stand upon [that Paul does not contradict Jesus"] if Paul said "be ye followers of me...." Why anyone argues there is a contradiction between Jesus and Paul here, I don't know. To me, it only means that Paul believes his behavior is an ideal replica of Jesus' behavior. That claim is what gives rise to contradiction by DEEDS, not words. For example, in Jesus was "no guile," but Paul boasts to the Corinthians of having captured them with "guile." The walk of Paul - his deeds -- contradicts the walk of Christ. So it is not true we should imitate Paul and thereby will replicate the walk of Jesus. Rather, Paul's walk is at odds with Jesus, and we must look only to Jesus' walk if we want to be disciples of the true Jesus. So I find this first point rather weak, and misdirected to not comprehend where the contradiction arises from this quote - not in words, but in deeds.</span></p>

(50 min)" data-mce-mark="1">In Jeffrey Daugherty's Apostle Paul Anti-Christ (Jan 2014), he writes a fictional work that claims to be based in history that claims (according to reviews) that Paul knew Jesus during His ministry. That perhaps he was the rich young ruler who went away chagrined he had to give his money to the poor. I don't think mixing pure speculation in a book of valid points commends a book that tries to have the ring of truth. It has to be small bits of narration to verifiable events to bring them alive, rather than bring to life speculative events along with true events.</span></p>
